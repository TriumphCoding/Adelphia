# Chapter 1 - About the Game

Who would you like to be; the personal bodyguard of a prince, setting out with him to find and rescue his long-lost father? Or maybe you want to be a sickly mage that, while traveling with a group of merchants, gets conscripted into the army and forced to fight for a cause you don’t believe in. Whatever you chose, your character will experience great adventure, epic battles, and even personal growth.

## Required Materials

+ A copy of this guide
+ A character sheet for each player
+ Two Ten-Sided dice for each player (2d10)
+ A Grid Map to track battle positions
+ Pencils and Scrap Paper

## Basic Rules

Overall, the game play itself is very simple. All characters have a collection of stats that represent how well they can perform. Using these stats, you will roll dice and determine how effective you were at that given moment.

### Rolling

Adelphia is a **Roll Under** system. Each player should have access to two ten sided dice. Except in one instance, you will be rolling the two ten sided dice to generate a random number between 0% and 99%. This is done by designating one of the two dice as the tens digit, and the other as the ones digit. You roll both dice, and read the result as a percentile. For example, a roll of 4 on the tens die and a 7 on the ones die is a 47%. A roll of a double zero, 00%, is therefore the best roll available, being the lowest roll possible. In formulas given later in the book, this process is abbreviated to **d%**, meaning roll the two 10 sided dice and use the percentile reading.

The other Instance of dice rolling is used when leveling up your character. Instead of reading the two ten sided dice as a single percentage, you will add the numbers together and use the total. So in the previous example, the 4 and the 7 would be worth a total of 11. You are still rolling under, again making a roll of double zero, 0 + 0, the best roll available. This is often abbreviated as **2d10**.

> *If you ever exactly roll the number you are trying to beat, that traditionally counts as a successful roll. If two rolls are opposing each other, a tie breaks in the direction of the character that is initiating action, and against the person defending against action. If two different people are "initiating", then break in the direction of the players over NPCs.*

### Attack Tests

All weapons have a listed **Range** and **Might**. To attack an opponent, you simply move your character within your equipped weapon’s Range and declare that you are performing an attack. Your target's **Dodge** stat is subtracted from your **Accuracy** stat, and that figured value is your **Hit Chance**. If your **d%** rolls under your Hit Chance, your attack succeeds and you damage your opponent. Otherwise, your attack fails and no damage is dealt.

When performing an Attack, you will also have a **Critical** chance, and your opponent will have an **Evade** Chance. Like your Hit Chance, your **Crit Chance** is the difference between these two values. if your **d%** roll from before also Rolls Under your Crit Chance, your attack is considered a critical hit, and deals Three times the damage it normally would.

Your weapon will determine what type of damage you deal, but traditionally it will be a flat value of either your **Strength** base stat plus your weapon's **Might**, reduced by your opponent's **Constitution**. Magic attacks will be your **Intelligence** base stat plus your weapon's **Might**, reduced by your opponent's **Wisdom**.

### Stat Tests

Usually, Stat Tests are used to activate "Combat Skills". To check against a Stat, you attempt a **d%** roll against your own **Base Stats**. In this case, your **Hit Chance** is the actual value of your Base Stat. Rolling under your stat means a successful test, and your Combat skill is performed. Some Tests will apply a x2 or a x1/2 modifier. Multiply your stat by this value (and round down) to get your Hit Chance. For game speed, you can use the **d%** roll for your Attack Test to pass a Stat Test. As long as your **d%** beats both, your attack works and your combat skill goes off. These may be abbreviated as **STR**%, **SPD**x2%, or **CON**x1/2%

### Quirk Tests

while the total number of **Quirks** may change depending on the type of campaign that is being run, traditionally your character will have four. Whenever you wish to perform an action outside of combat, you are going to choose one of these quirks to represent your familiarity with the task. Then, you will choose one of your **Base Stats** to represent how you are going about the task. Add your Stat, and the check's **Difficulty Bonus** to get your **Hit Chance** for that Skill Check. If your **d%** rolls under your Hit Chance, you successfully accomplish the task you set out to perform.

If your **d%** roll would also pass a **LUK**%, your Quirk Test is critically successful. Storyline related, something unusually lucky happens during this task.
\page
### Leveling Up

Every significant combat increases your character's level by one. All base stats have a **Potential** to increase each level. To perform the level up, roll **2d10** against every **Base Stat** and see if you Roll Under that base stat's Potential. If you are successful, that stat increases by one point.

### Conflicting Rules

All of the rules listed here are for basic reference. Often times you might have abilities or weapons that override these basic rules, like a weapon that deals damage based on your **Dexterity**. In all cases, the more specific rule changes the more general rule.
\page
# Chapter 2 - Game Stats

Before creating a character, it is important to understand each stat and their effect. This understanding will help to determine how you want your character’s personality reflected numerically.

## Base Stats

Your Base Stats determine the basic characteristics that you will be interacting with. These are used for **Stat Tests** and **Aspect Tests**, and will be combined with your Equipment to determine your **Calculated Stats**. The Calculated Stats are what actually govern combat.

### Hit Points (HP)

HP determines how much damage your character can take before falling unconscious on the battle field. Every time an opponent successfully lands a hit on you, any damage you take is tracked by reducing your HP. Upon hitting "0" current HP, you will be removed from the current combat, and may even be dead depending on the situation that caused you to drop to 0.

### Strength (STR)

Strength determines how physically strong your character is. The more strength you have, the more damage each attack you land deals. Traditionally, Strength is opposed by your opponent's **Constitution**

### Intelligence (INT)

Intelligence determines how book-smart your character is. The more Intelligence you have, the more damage each tome you use deals, and the effectiveness of some staffs increase. Traditionally, Intelligence is opposed by your opponent's **Wisdom**.
> *When dealing with mental stat-based roll-play, you should never feel forced to perform in a particular way solely because of the value of your stats. Having a low intelligence might mean you have difficulty applying your raw intelligence to particular tasks, but it does not have to mean your character is stupid.*

### Dexterity (DEX)

Dexterity determines the quality of your technique with your equipped weapon. More Dexterity increases both the **Accuracy** and **Critical** chance of your attacks. Traditionally, Dexterity is opposed you your opponent's **Speed**.

### Speed (SPD)

Speed determines how fast you are in direct combat. More speed increases both your **Dodge** chance, and your chance to **Follow Through Attack**.

### Luck (LUK)

Luck is a cosmic force that generally affects everything you might do. Luck gives a small boon to your **Accuracy**, a small boost to you **Dodge**, and is a significant amount of your **Evade**. Luck also determines your chance of critically passing Aspect Tests.

### Constitution (CON)

Constitution determines how much of a physical attack you can just shrug off. Constitution contributes to your **Defence**

### Wisdom (WIS)

Wisdom determines how much of a Magical Damage you can shrug off. Wisdom contributes to your **Resistance**

### Movement (MOV)

Movement determines how many spaces your character can move on the battlefield. Unlike the rest of your stats, movement doesn't increase by leveling up.

## Calculated Stats

**Calculated Stats** are the statistics used for combat. These represent how much damage you can deal, how accurate you are, and how well you avoid damage. These stats are combined with your weapon stats, so be sure to include your chosen weapon in their calculations.

### Might (MGT)

Might is the Damage your attacks will deal. The weapon you've equipped will tell you how to calculate this value. Might is opposed by your opponents **Defense** or **Resistance**, again based on the weapon's characteristics.

### Accuracy (ACC)

Accuracy dictates your chance to hit your opponent. It is calculated by adding twice your **Dexterity** and half your **Luck** to your weapon’s Accuracy. Accuracy is opposed by your opponent's **Dodge**. Remember in all cases to round down.

### Critical (CRIT)

Critical dictates the chance that you will strike a vital spot on your opponent, which inflicts Three times the **Damage** of a regular attack. It is calculated by adding half your **Dexterity** to your weapon’s Critical. Critical is opposed by your opponent's **Evade**. Remember in all cases to round down.
\page
### Dodge (DGE)

Dodge represents your ability to evade enemy attacks. It is calculated by adding twice your **Speed** to your **Luck** and your weapon's Dodge.

### Avoid (AVO)

Avoid represents your ability to evade enemy critical strikes. It is calculated by adding your **Luck** to your weapon's Avoid.

### Defense (DEF)

Defense represents your ability to shrug off physical attacks. It is calculated by adding your **Constitution** to your weapon's Defense.

### Resistance (RES)

Resistance represents your ability to shrug off magical attacks. It is calculated by adding your **Wisdom** to your weapon's Resistance.

### Summary

| Stat       | Abbrev | Calculation                          | Opposes        |
| ---        | ---    | ---                                  | ---            |
| Might      | MGT    | (*STR* or *MAG*) + *W.MGT*           | *DEF* or *RES* |
| Accuracy   | ACC    | (2 x *DEX*) + (½  x *LUK*) + *W.ACC* | *DGE*          |
| Critical   | CRT    | (½  x *DEX*) + *W.CRT*               | *AVO*          |
| Dodge      | DGE    | (2 x *SPD*) + *LUK* + *W.DGE*        | *ACC*          |
| Avoid      | AVO    | *LUK* + *W.AVO*                      | *CRT*          |
| Defense    | DEF    | *CON* + *W.DEF*                      | *MGT*          |
| Resistance | RES    | *WIS* + *W.RES*                      | *MGT*          |

# Chapter 3 - Character Creation

In addition to these basic rules, your **Game Master** may have specific guidelines she would like you to follow, or she may have even overwritten parts of this book herself. As with all pen and paper RPGs, work with the people at your table to make sure that everyone is on the same page about the types of characters that your game will support.
>*You may wish to review the sections on classes, combat, combat skills, out of combat, and equipment when making your character. Doing so can help guide you toward the type of character you wish to create.*

## Overview

In order to create a character, you are going to be performing the following steps:

1. Assign your **Growth Points**
1. Assign your **Class Points**
1. Choose your **Creature Type**
1. **Level Up** to level 1.
1. Choose your **Starting Equipment**
1. Figure your **Calculated Stats**
1. Choose your Character's final details

Once everyone has finished making their character, you are ready to start playing.

## Growth Points

Your character's **Growth** determines how each of your character's stats will change over time. Every base stat (excluding **Movement**) starts at the minimum Growth rate of "5". Then, you can spend up to 35 points raising each of these growth rates (again, excluding **Movement**). As an Example:

### Monico Aaronway Growth

| Stat      | Base   | Growth | Total  |
| :---      | ---:   | ---:   | ---:   |
| HP        | 5      | 5      | 10     |
| STR       | 5      | 6      | 11     |
| INT       | 5      | 1      | 6      |
| DEX       | 5      | 7      | 12     |
| SPD       | 5      | 6      | 11     |
| LUK       | 5      | 5      | 10     |
| CON       | 5      | 3      | 8      |
| WIS       | 5      | 2      | 7      |
| MOV       | N/A    | N/A    | N/A    |
| **Total** | **40** | **35** | **75** |

## Class Points

Your character's **Class** is what determines your character's stats right now. Your character's **Hit Points** start off at 10, and your character's **Movement** starts off at 5. All other stats start off at 2. In addition, not every stat is worth the same amount in combat. **HP** is purchased at a rate of 3 HP per point. **Luck** is purchased at 2 LUK per point. And MOV takes 2 points to increase once. Overall, you have 20 points to spend on your class. As an example:

### Monico Aaronway Stats

| Stat      | Base | Rate | Spent  | Gained | Total             |
| :---      | ---: | ---: | ---:   | ---:   | ---:              |
| HP        | 10   | x3   | 2      | +6     | 10 + 6 = **16**   |
| STR       | 2    | x1   | 4      | +4     | 2 + 4 = **6**     |
| INT       | 2    | x1   | 0      | +0     | 2 + 0 = **2**     |
| DEX       | 2    | x1   | 4      | +4     | 2 + 4 = **6**     |
| SPD       | 2    | x1   | 4      | +4     | 2 + 4 = **6**     |
| LUK       | 2    | x2   | 2      | +4     | 2 + 4 = **6**     |
| CON       | 2    | x1   | 2      | +2     | 2 + 2 = **4**     |
| WIS       | 2    | x1   | 0      | +0     | 2 + 0 = **2**     |
| MOV       | 5    | x0.5 | 2      | +1     | 5 + 1 = **6**     |
| **Total** |      |      | **20** |        |                   |

However, you may not want to follow our example character so closely, because in addition to spending points on your Starting Character stats, you can also purchase **Class Abilities**. But don't worry too much, as you'll get more Class points as you **level up**.

## Class Abilities

You can spend your **Class Points** on abilities that might be relevant to your character, and truly set them apart from everyone else. Each ability costs a certain number of Class Points. Simply spend the points to activate the Class Ability, and you can have as many as you can afford.

>*While all of these class abilities are named and themed, don't feel beholden to their exact flavor. Taking **Ride** might mean your character moves uncannily quickly, or **Fly** might mean your character has access to some form of flight magic and not necessarily wings. Use what makes sense for you, and the setting you are in.*

### Nobility

*Cost: 4* - Your family line has a history, and you have the potential to grow into that history. Get +1 to all your Growth Rates.

### Ride

*Cost: 4* - You are trained in riding a horse, and can put your enhanced mobility to good use in the field. You can spend unspent movement after performing an action each turn.
\page
### Fly

*Cost: 4* - You are trained in moving through the air, and can move in ways a grounded person cannot. You ignore all terrain movement costs, and can fly over most impassable terrain. *Please work with your GM about what constitutes flight indoors*

### Armored

*Cost: 2* - You are trained in the use of Heavy Armor, and are a mobile battlefield wall. Gain +4 CON, +3 HP, -1 MOV, +1 HP Growth, +2 CON Growth.

### Runed

*Cost: 2* - You are trained in the use of Protective Runes, and are otherwise magically shielded. Gain +4 WIS, +3 HP, -1 MOV, +1 HP Growth, +2 WIS Growth.

### Sing

*Cost: 3* - You can inspire your allies around you to action. You can spend your action performing for one of your allies that has already taken their action [**Range 1**]. They recover all spent movement and may take another turn, as though it was the start of their turn again. (They can take their second turn any time during this allied phase).

### Combat Skill

*Cost: 3* - You have trained in a specialized form of combat, and you gain 1 **Combat Skill Point**. See the section on combat skills for what you can spend this on. You can purchase this background as many times as you'd like.

### Weapon Skill

*Cost: 2* - You have trained in more than a single form of self defense. Every character has access to one weapon type for free. However, if you would like to wield additional weapons categories, you will need to purchase this skill. You can purchase this background as many times as you'd like

## Creature Type

Creature Types add a little bit of fantasy flavor to your setting. Work with your GM to see if this list has been changed or customized for the setting you are using. If you prefer a lower fantasy, there should be no problem making every character human, there will be plenty of room for differentiation elsewhere. These replace the "base" values in the above creation examples.
\column
### Human

Humans are the base to which all other creatures compare. They lean in into whatever interests them the most, and are highly adaptable.

|Human   | HP | STR | INT | DEX | SPD | LUK | DEF | RES | MOV |
|---     | ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|
| Base   |  10|    2|    2|    2|    2|    2|    2|    2|    5|
| Growth |   5|    5|    5|    5|    5|    5|    5|    5|  N/A|

### Elf

Elves move quickly and gracefully, and tend to need to avoid danger instead of taking it head on.

|Elf     | HP | STR | INT | DEX | SPD | LUK | DEF | RES | MOV |
|---     | ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|
| Base   |   7|    2|    2|    3|    4|    2|    0|    2|    5|
| Growth |   4|    5|    5|    7|    6|    5|    3|    5|  N/A|

### Dwarf

Dwarves are stout and hearty. They tend to be direct with their problem solving, for both their good and their ill.

### Carnivore

One of your ancestors made a pact with the spirit of a carnivorous animal. the remnants of that pact remains in you, with your animalistic attitude and appearance. Which animal it was is up to you.

### Custom

If there is an idea for a player creature type that isn't on this list, feel free to choose one of the base creature types and flavor it differently. If that doesn't get the point across, a safe bet for a custom creature type is to follow the point rules, and adjust the human base points up and down, keeping the net base point value neutral.
>*Be careful going more than 5 points of adjustment, though, or more than a +/- 3 to a particular stat base or growth. As always, work with your DM when performing custom plans not covered in this book.*

## Choosing Equipment

All characters start the game with the following:

1. A Rank D Weapon
1. A Rank E Weapon
1. A Pouch of healing herbs
\column
## Leveling Up

Once you've made all of your decisions, and have assigned all of your points, it's time to roll to see your first level.

For each stat with a growth, roll 2d10 and add them together. Do remember that the 10 sided dice goes from 0-9, not 1-10, to keep reading them consistent across both the d% and the 2d10 rolls. As long as you roll under that stat's growth, increase your stat by 1 point. Ties work out in your favor.

For example:

### Monico Aaronway Levelup

| INT       | 6      | 18   | +1     | 2    | **3** |

| SPD       | 11     | 10   | +1     | 6    | **7** |
| LUK       | 10     | 10   | +1     | 6    | **7** |
| CON       | 8      |  9   | +0     | 4    | 4     |
| WIS       | 7      |  0   | +1     | 2    | **3** |
| MOV       | N/A    | N/A  | +0     | 6    | 6     |
| **Total** |        |      | **+6** |      |       |

### Optional Level Up Rules

Sometimes, the randomness of a level up system can feel oppressive. To help mitigate this, consider some of the following changes:

**No Bad Levels**: After rolling your stats, if you didn't gain at least 3 increases, start rerolling the stats you didn't get until you get at least 3 increases. Start rerolling from HP and work your way down the list of missed stats. Once you hit 3 total stat increases, don't continue.

**No Bad Stats**: Every time you finish a level up, if you didn't gain a particular stat, increase your growth in that stat by 1. Once you do gain that stat, reset your growth back to your base growth rate.

**Static Levels**: Instead of rolling your stats, you gain your growth as stat experience points. Once you get 18 points or more in a single stat, drop your exp by 18, and increase that stat by 1.
>*Often times, this can be useful to create a character over level 1, without rolling thousands of dice. Use {Growth} x {Starting Level} / 18 to determine how many stat growths you received over those levels, and then continue using the level up system of your choice. Always round down, regardless of how high the decimal portion is.*

# Chapter 4 - Character Definition

Your characters are more than a bundle of numbers. They have personality, hobbies, and areas of interest that a simple stat line can't express. These character quirks influence how they interact with the world, and allow for a more general level of expression that many situations might call for.

When telling the game's story, many situations won't call for an application of direct force. Instead, one's experience and personality can be used to overcome those types of challenges. In these cases, you'll chose a quirk and one of your base stats, and together you will determine if you successfully overcome the challenge, or if the challenge overcomes you.

## Character Quirks

Character quirks are brief descriptions of who your character is, and what your character knows. In general, there are about 5 different types of quirks that you could name, but the specifics of those quirks are up to you.
:
*While it's OK to double-up, and give yourself two or more quirks of the same type, these are really here to help you get into your character's head, and assist in the "Roll Playing" part of the game. Making sure you have a couple of different types should encourage you to have a breadth to your character, and make them more interesting to bring to bear when the steel isn't swinging around.*
:
**Vocation**: This is a description of a job your character might have, or would have if they weren't currently tied up in whatever is going on in the game's story right now. Were you a baker, or an Alchemist? Maybe you would be a translator for a bunch of traveling merchants. Maybe a noble, in charge of managing a big estate.
:
**Hobby**: is a pastime your character might do for fun, and is probably spending a a good bit of their currently remaining free time on. Are you into painting, or singing? Do you hand-sew cursed dolls? Maybe you hunt, or race horses?
:
*Depending on the hobby, there might be overlap here with your vocation, so try to remember your hobby is usually an escape from your job. Or maybe it your character's case it isn't. That's interesting to know, too.*
:
**Interest**: Unlike a Vocation or a Hobby, an interest is usually an area of knowledge you know a surprising amount about, and go out of your way to keep up with. Do you follow the Noble Gossip, and can name every member of the kingdom's court? Do you know the difference between a regular and war scythe? Are you an expert in impractical magic, even if you're no good with a spellbook in an actual fight?
:
**Relationship**: Some people partially define themselves by their relationships with other people. Maybe you are a father, or an older sister. Maybe you grew up in an orphanage? Maybe your relationship is to yourself, and the person you used to be? Did you have to leave a former teammate behind?
:
**Other**: Sometimes, something character defining doesn't fit cleanly into the above categories. That's OK, as long as it's useful as a guide to who you are. Maybe you are an anxious perfectionist in everything you do? Maybe you've learned to get around in life without one of your limbs?
:
*Remember, you are going to be choosing more than one quirk. No one thing should be the sole definition of a character. In addition, even if these are the biggest areas of your character's life and personality, they might not be the only aspects. These are guidelines, not rails.*

## Using Quirks

Quirks are used to determine how your character thinks about and overcomes unique challenges that they may face. "I don't know anything about alchemy, but I was a chef before the war broke out. Making one specific potion is just like following a recipe, right? I can do that!"

To be specific, once you determine that an obstacle in the narrative has presented itself, you will choose a quirk that you believe might help out in that situation. Then, the Game master will determine how difficult the desired task would be for someone keeping up with that particular hobby, interest, etc. Finally, you will chose a method by which you will carry our your desired action, to be represented by choosing one of your particular **Base Stats**. (Do not choose HP, LUK, or MOV for this). With this, you'll roll a **quirk test** to see how well you managed to accomplish this task in the current setting.

| Difficulty Name | Difficulty Bonus |
| :---            | :---             |
| Trivial         | 100 + *stat*     |
| Easy            | 75 + *stat*      |
| Average         | 50 + *stat*      |
| Difficult       | 25 + *stat*      |
| Legendary       | 0 + *stat*       |
| Impossible      | -25 + *stat*     |

If you pass the quirk test, you accomplish, or make progress toward, your desired outcome.
\page
### Making Progress

Sometimes, it pays to break a task down into multiple parts, allowing multiple characters to chip in and accomplish a goal. In this case, you will assign a task HP, usually some number between 2 and 12. Then, you will choose a difficulty at which you would consider progress being made toward that goal, instead of simply accomplishing the task outright. If you match the tier of difficulty, deal 2 damage against the task. for every additional tier of difficulty your quirk test would have cleared, deal an additional 1 damage.

In addition, choose an HP value for the party. for every tier of difficulty a given roll fails by, deal 1 damage to the party. Once the party is "defeated", the outcome that they didn't want occurs.
:
*While more information is available in the sections about running the game, as a rule of thumb the task should have about twice the HP as the party. So the party might have 2 HP for a 4 HP task, or 3 HP for a 6 HP task.*

### Getting Close

Did someone fail a skill check by only one tier of difficulty? if they did, maybe someone else at the table can come up with a way that their character might be able to help. If so, they can make an attempt against the difficulty of the task (even if the way they are helping is surprisingly simple, like bringing snacks to a person doing a large amount of research). If they succeed, then the person counts as succeeding at exactly the level difficulty.
:
*Feel Free to make use of other narrative devices during this time, like flashing back to a swordsmanship lesson between your two characters.*
:
Alternatively, the Game Master may offer the character a penalty in exchange for succeeding on the roll anyway. Usually, this is a narrative penalty that might cost the character progress toward a personal goal, or momentary safety, in exchange for progress now.
:
*For example, if trying to escape a city, your character might take the penalty of dropping a personal item, that might be used to identify them later, as a cost for making progress toward escaping right now. Or, maybe the character scaling a wall cuts their hand as they catch themselves from falling, and is at -3 Dex for the upcoming combat after they get to the top.*
\column
### Critical Success

In addition to your hard work and dedication, sometimes you just get lucky. If the number you roll on your quirk test also rolls under your **LUK** stat, you are **Critically Successful** in the situation. Note, you must succeed in general in order to be critically successful, in the case of Legendary or Impossible tasks.

If making progress toward a long term goal, you get to make two more attempts right now, with no penalty for missing. If it's an immediate goal, then something extra happens in addition to succeeding.
:
*While scaling a wall, you critically succeed. When you get to the top, the guards are nowhere to be found, you happened to time your ascent perfectly with their patrol route.*

## Choosing Quirks

Ultimately, it is the Game Master's Choice as to how many quirks are chosen and assigned. In general, a smaller number of quirks makes playing with a larger cast of characters easier, at the cost of making each individual character a little more one dimensional.

In general, though, the recommended number of quirks is 4. The GM will choose a themed quirk for the campaign. Every character will have a quirk that ties them to the campaign together. For example, "High-Seas Privateers" or "Adventurers for Hire". Work with your GM if you have a slight modification to this quirk that would bring more of your personal characterization out, but the change should still be on theme. Afterwords, choose 3 more quirks to round your character out.
:
*The recommended starting quirks are a Vocation, a Hobby, and an Interest, but if you have something specific in mind don't feel tied down to those three exactly.*
:
Non Player Characters should have 2 quirks total, one to represent who they are in the story, and one to represent something interesting about their character to add background flavor and interest.

### Example Quirk Selection

**Monico Aaronway** is a sword-for-hire doing what she can to take care of her younger brother after their parents passed away. He inherited his father's knack for magic, and although she has no head for the stuff herself, she's been helping him study it as she bounces from place to place trying to get by. Her sword forms that she practices reminds her of the dancing lessons she was given, back in more stable times.

1. *Campaign*: Traveling vagabond.
1. *Hobby*: Dances, even when watched.
1. *Interest*: Elemental Magic is fascinating.
1. *Relationship*: Older sister and caretaker.

**Auric Aaronway** is Monico's younger brother and a budding magical prodigy. Raised by his sister, he moves around with her practicing his magic, and doing his best to help her out when he can. He dreams of becoming a famous and powerful wizard that can pay his sister back for all she's done for him.

1. *Campaign*: Traveling vagabond.
1. *Vocation*: Student of Magic.
1. *Hobby*: Cooking is alchemy you eat.
1. *Interest*: Famous witches and wizards.

**Kikuchiyo** is a cyborg rescued and reassembled by the Aaronway's. Discovered by Monico, and repaired by Auric, Kikuchiyo has sworn to protect them. Kikuchiyo often refers to his programming as his "Code of Honor", and claims that he has taken an oath to not break from it. The only sign of his former humanity is his fire-red hair emanating from his helmet and headpiece.

1. *Campaign*: Clockwork Traveler
1. *Vocation*: Gingineer
1. *Hobby*: Farming. Or at least Scarecrows.
1. *Relationship*: Time-honored Honor Guard.

# Chapter 5 - Character Growth, Skills, Weapons, and Runes

Your characters are not static. Everything they do informs who they are, and what they can do. And as your character grows, they will find more than just increased stats. They will develop specialized skills, and acquire equipment worthy of their status.

## Gaining Levels

Every significant story beat grants a level up.

## Story Beats

The above is hard to explain in specific, but it should feel very natural at the table. Ultimately, these are determined by the GM, but as a rough rule of thumb, any time your characters would feel like they have accomplished something, they should level up. For example:

- Clearing out a cave filled with monsters.
- Running around a town to successfully raise a defense.
- Defending that town from the assault at the walls.
- Putting together the pieces and casting a magic ritual.
- Guard a caravan moving from point A to point B
- Escaping a city while being chased by the guards.
- Clearing out a floor of an enemy stronghold, and moving on to the next.

To execute the level up, follow the rules given in chapter 3.

## Gaining Skills

Every 5 levels, you get a skill point. Unlike your stats, which are always applied, skill points grant conditional combat bonuses, and further encourage combat differentiation. Each skill costs one skill point, and skills can be taken multiple times.

## Gaining Weapons

As your character's level increases, the power of the weapons they have access to also increase. Every 10 levels, a new tier of weapons will be unlocked. In addition, at the halfway point between those levels you will be granted unlimited access to the previous tier of weapons.
:
*If this sections feels a little loose in the explanation as to when you receive your weapons, it's that weaponry are physical things, and unlike skills you can be a little bit looser at the exact moment of acquisition. The narrative might grant you access to the weapon a level or two early or late. Maybe as your reward for slaying a monster threatening a town a new weapon is given to the party. That might not be exactly at level 20, and that's OK. Remember, as with all narrative aspects of the game, to work with the DM to make sure everyone is having a good time.*
:
Roughly speaking, weapon levels follow the below schedule:

|Tier | Level | Metal     | First Acquired Level | Full Access Level
|:--- | :---  |:---       | :---                 | :---
| E   | 1     |Copper     | 1                    | 5
| D   | 2     |Bronze     | 1                    | 15
| C   | 3     |Iron       | 10                   | 25
| B   | 4     |Steel      | 20                   | 35
| A   | 5     |Silvered   | 30                   | 45
| S   | 6     |Gilded     | 40                   | 55
| S+  | 7     |Orichalcum | 50                   | 65

Taking Steel weapons as an example, at level 10 you will gain access to your first steel weapon. As your level increases, you might be able to trade out that steel weapon for others that are level appropriate, but you won't be able to fill out an arsenal of steel weapons. At level 35, you will roughly have access to the resources to swap out any steel weapon basically at will, as long as the narrative supports your access to these weapons.

Some weapons are naturally more effective when brought to bear against someone using the wrong weapon type. This is represented by the following relationship:

- **Red** weapons beat **Green** Weapons
- **Green** weapons beat **Blue** weapons
- **Blue** weapons beat **Red** weapons

If your weapon beats your opponent's, increase your **Accuracy** by 10 per weapon level, and increase your **Might** by 1 per weapon level. If your weapon loses to your opponent, instead decrease your **Might** and **Accuracy** by that same amount.

For example, if your accuracy is 87 while wielding an iron sword, and you are going to be striking a mage wielding a Bronze Thunder Spell, you would instead attack with 117 accuracy. If the mage had 91 accuracy, their riposte would instead by at 71 accuracy.

Outside of this cycle, weapons don't change. So Red weapons fighting Grey weapons don't change their **Accuracy** or **Might**. Same for a Blue weapon fighting a Blue weapon.

## Weapon Types

Weapon types are separated into two different types of categorization plans. **Physical Weapons** are weapons wielded by your **STR** and defended by your target's **CON**, and **Magic Weapons** are wielded by your **INT** and defended by your target's **WIS**. In addition, weapons are assigned a color: **Red** weapons are more effective against **Green** weapons, **Green** weapons are more effective against **Blue** weapons, and **Blue** weapons are more effective against **Red** weapons. **Grey** weapons are neutral in all combats. On character creation, everyone gets to choose one weapon type that they are familiar with. You can't wield a weapon type you are unfamiliar with.

Some weapons have multiple sub-categories, for example a **Katana** is a type of **Sword**. All subtypes are minor variations of the base type of weapon. When equipping a sub-type, use the stats of the main-type weapon, then apply the sub-type changes to it.

### Sword

Swords are the standard fantasy weapon. They are useful in most situations, and you'll never really go wrong with having one by your side.

A **Katana** is a type of sword that encourages quickness and speed over defense. Wielding a Katana increases your **SPD** by 1 and decreases your **CON** and **WIS** by 1 per weapon level.

## Gaining Runes

In a world of fantasy and magic, Weapons can be more than simple metal tools. Placing a rune into a weapon fills it with magical properties. Like weapons, the runes that your character has access to are roughly determined by level.

|Tier | Level | Metal     | Acquired Level
|:--- | :---  |:---       | :---
| D   | 1     |Bronze     | 4
| C   | 1     |Iron       | 8
| C   | 2     |Iron       | 12
| B   | 1     |Steel      | 16

| B   | 3     |Steel      | 24

| A   | 2     |Silvered   | 32
| A   | 3     |Silvered   | 36
| A   | 4     |Silvered   | 40

| S   | 4     |Gilded     | 56
| S   | 5     |Gilded     | 60

When choosing a weapon, you will traditionally choose a weapon metal and a rune for that metal that you meet the requirements for. Some runes get more powerful depending on the rune's level, and some runes have a minimum level requirement in order to place them. For example, if a rune requires "Level 2", you can't place one on an Iron weapon until level 12, and you can't place them on a steel weapon until level 20. You can never place that rune on a Bronze weapon. The Minimum Level requirement of the rune is listed after the rune name.

*Or don't. A great skill is a kind of defining super attack for your character. However, if you aren't feeling it, talk with your GM and see if you can change it out. Try not to be strategic with this, the skill should feel like a part of who your character is.*

## Items

Items are a bit looser than the rest of the weapons and skills in this section. In general, by about level 5 in a tier, a character should have an item of that tier's level. Since you can only really have one item at a time, there's no real reason to have a gate on them, give them out as rewards as feels thematic or appropriate. As a rough guide, hand out an item on levels that end in 5, so 5 - 15 - 25 - 35 - 45 - 55 - 65 - 75.

# Chapter 6 - Combat

Sometimes, fights break out, and you need to be prepared to deal with this. Combat is exciting, dangerous, and deadly. Do try not to die.

Combat seems complicated, but as long as you can break it down into all of it's steps, you will find that there is nothing that is individually that difficult

## Strike a target

In order to actually perform a strike, find your **Accuracy** and your opponent's **Dodge**. Subtract them to get your **Hit Chance**. Also find your **Critical** and your opponents **Avoid** and take the difference to get your **Crit Chance**. Last, roll your **d%**,

If you roll below your **Hit Chance**, you successfully strike your opponent. Take your **Might**, and subtract off your opponent's **Defense**. This is how much damage you manage to inflict. This does mean that you might deal 0 damage against a sufficiently armored foe. If you also managed to roll under your **Crit Chance**, you critically strike and deal 3 times the damage you would inflict with your standard attack. Again, 3 times 0 is zero.

However, most opponent's aren't going to simply stand there and take it. they will try to **Riposte**

## Engaging a Foe

When you engage with a foe to attack them, you will run through the following 4 strikes:

1. The attacker **Attacks**
1. The defender **Ripostes**
1. The attacker **Follow Through Attacks**, if available
1. The defender **Follow Through Ripostes**, if available

The person declaring the attack goes first, and attempts to strike the defender. Once that strike is resolved, if the defender is still alive they will attempt to strike back in a **Riposte**. This strike is calculated the exact same way as a regular strike, but some skills or runes might only apply to **attacks** or **ripostes**.

Then, once both the attacker and the defender have resolved their attacks and ripostes, the attackers **follow through attacks** trigger. These are any secondary attacks granted by your speed or other abilities. Last, the defender resolves any of their **follow through ripostes**.

In all engagements, a **follow through** is granted if your **SPD** is 4 greater than your opponent's **SPD**. So an attacker with 4 Speed and a defender with 1 speed will not trigger a **follow through attack**. A defender with 8 **SPD** and an attacker with 4 **SPD** will be granted a **Follow through riposte**. When that same defender declares an attack on their turn, they will be granted a **follow through attack**. Some skills or weapon runes might grant additional **Follow through** strikes. If you are granted more than 1, they all trigger in a row during the appropriate follow through phase.

## Range

All of the above assumes that everyone's weapons can actually reach. While we'll go over the grid more fully in a short bit, all weapons have a range. You can only engage with a foe at at a range supported by your weapon, and if you are engaged, you can only riposte if your weapon supports the range your enemy has chosen to engage at.

## Movement

Full Combat takes place on a square gridded combat map. Every character has a movement stat that dictates how far they can move on a turn. Traditionally, you can move as far as you want each turn, but once you perform an action your turn is over, and any unused movement is wasted. You spend 1 movement to enter a new square.

Some squares might be fortified terrain. These cost additional movement to enter, but may provide additional defensive stats.

| Terrain Type  | Movement | Defense | Dodge | HP Recovery  |
| ---           | ---      | ---     | ---   | ---          |
| Basic         | 1        | 0       | 0     | 0            |
| Light         | 2        | 1       | 10    | 0            |
| Medium        | 2        | 2       | 20    | 0            |
| Heavy         | 3        | 3       | 30    | 10           |
| Difficult (N) | N        | 0       | 0     | 0            |

For example, fighting on stairs might be considered fighting on light fortification, and getting into an arrow-slit might count as taking Medium Fortification. Characters with the **Flight** class ability only pay 1 point of movement for all terrain type movements.

Most walls block movement completely, along with most short objects and fortifications. Characters with **Flight** can end their movement on these, hovering in place, but do try to keep in mind the physics of the situation. A character with flight can't fly over indoor walls, for example.
\page
## Actions in Combat

Traditionally, there are two actions you can take for each of your turns in combat: Move and Engage. Move lets you spend your movement points to move around the battlefield, and Engage lets you attack an enemy. Some objects might be able to be interacted with, this takes your Engagement action. Some skills allow you to interact with your allies, these also take your Engage Action.

Switching weapons that you are currently carrying is not an action. Neither are things like talking. However, some things like "catching someone up" on the situation at hand might be an action. In fact, if you need to explain a complicated plan under a time crunch, the DM might actually instigate an HP total for the explanation and make you roll skill checks. These skill checks require an engagement action.

## Combat Phases

Combat takes place in phases. Once combat has been decided upon, all participants divide into the combat sides. Under normal conditions, all players will be on one side of the combat, and all enemies will be on the other. During the **Hero Phase**, all players take turns in whatever order they feel is the most advantageous. Once everyone has spent their movement and taken their desired action, combat moves to the **Enemy Phase**.

The Game Master then takes all of the turns for the enemies, Moving and engaging as desired, until they feel that all actions have been made. The phase last returns to the **Ally Phase**

Sometimes, stakes in a combat can't be cleanly sorted into Heroes and Enemies. roughly speaking, there are 4 types of combatants:

1. The Heroes, made up of all the players in the game
1. The Enemies, those directly opposing the heroes.
1. The Allies, groups of people that may be outside the Players control, but otherwise working of the Player's benefit.
1. The Independents, groups that are present in the battlefield but otherwise have goals independent to the Players or their Enemies.

The play phase actually continues like this: The Heroes take their turns. then any enemy teams present take theirs. More than one enemy team can exist, but often there isn't a reason to manage them separately, the DM will use their judgement here. Then, any allies of the Heroes will make their moves, again the DM making their choices. Once all allies have had their turn, any independents in the field will make their move. Last, play will pass back to the Heroes, and this continues until the reason for conflict is resolved.
\column
## Starting a Combat

Traditionally speaking, the GM will map out the area that the players can currently see, including all enemies visible. The GM will then mark out a bounding box for any of the players to place their starting characters into. This allows you to roleplay in the theater of the mind with out having to care about the combat grid until combat actually starts.
:
*One way of doing things is to set up the situation, draw the bounding box for the characters, and place them inside the box however they want to be placed. Then, hold off on the combat and do whatever roleplay for that scene you wish to accomplish. If the narration makes an excuse for it, a player may leave the box and walk off with an enemy, but only then does their position matter. If combat breaks out, any player outside the box is stuck in their current position, but any inside the box get to freely rearrange to start the combat.*

## Finishing Combat

Usually, the Allies will have a goal in mind. Break through the enemy line. Defeat the enemy commander. Escape the town. Rescue the citizens. Combat ends when there is no enemy in a position to prevent this goal from being realized.

So for example, if the Players are trying to break into a city controlled by a corrupt leader, combat won't be engaged with. You as players will use your quirks to overcome any challenges that you might encounter. However, if a quirk test goes bad, and you are spotted, now combat itself breaks out.

IN that situation, the players will fight their way through the couple of guards that are around, and if they manage to get past them combat will drop and you will continue with the story the way it was going before. However, "Get past them" might take many different forms

- Dropping all guards HP to zero.
- Moving to the opposite side of the combat map and escaping the combat
- Using their Quirks to intimidate the guards, scaring them away.

Regardless, once combat is no longer in the way of the players, the game becomes easier to run in an entirely narrative fashion.
\page
## Quick Combats with Zones

This is a tool for the Game Master to choose to employ, because sometimes fights break out in places that they don't have a good map for. In these cases, you can create a simple map using zones. There is no limit to the number of characters that can be in the same zone, and characters can only engage with things in their current zone. Zones are loosely connected to each other, and moving to a new zone costs 3 Movement or an Engage action.

When engaging, it is assumed to be at the **Range** that gives the attacker the most advantage. In addition, players with the **provoke** skill must be engaged with before anyone else in the zone they are currently occupying.

## Death

Whenever any character, enemy or player, loses their last point of HP, that character is removed from the current combat. Death, however, is not necessarily inevitable.

For enemies, the player landing the final blow gets to decide if that attack is lethal or not. This is mainly for roleplay purposes. Any enemy tha the GM deems significant may instead "retreat" from the combat upon losing their last point of HP, surviving to hound the players again.

For players, losing their last point of HP is an interesting situation. There are roughly 3 ways to handle this, and I would leave it up to the gaming group to determine how death is handled.

First, you could have a character losing all of their HP signify death. That character is dead, out of the game, and the player should either create a new character to be introduced, or potentially pick up the mantle of an NPC closely aligned with the players, placing that character under the player's control.

Second, you could simply only count complete party wipes as death. Simply having one person survive to the end of a combat challenge implies that everyone got through. This makes combat more abstract, but it does make people more willing to be aggressive in combat, which might be desirable.

Last, you could cut the difference, and resolve the situation kind of narrativly. If a player loses their HP, any other player can spend an "Engagement action" to stabilize the fallen character. If a character is stabilized, then they survive the encounter and can be revived later. If the players are forced to continue along without being able to perform this action, then the character is lost to the enemy, and it is up to the DM if the character is captured or dead. Regardless, the character has fallen out of the story for now, and the character's player should continue along as through the character had died.

## Multiple Characters

Each player should have their own character that they are controlling. However, the story may make it necessary to have multiple people join with the players to accomplish their goals. In that case, instead of adding an ally phase, consider allowing the players to collectively control the actions these extra characters take during combat. If there are enough of these characters, assign particular players to be responsible for them.

## Example Combat

*ToDo: A simple combat example, with pictures. Also figure out how to put pictures in Markdown.*

# Chapter 7 - Monsters and Traps

The world is a populous place. People, monsters, and other things exist that would hold the players from accomplishing their goals. As a Game Master, it is your job to bring these to bear against the players.

## A GMs Responsibility

As a Game Master, your responsibility is to make sure that everyone at the gaming table is having a good time. Regardless of anything else in this section, you and your players should be having fun. The biggest effect that this has is on difficulty. The advice in this section will be tuned to a Medium difficulty, designed to allow players to feel powerful, but with just enough threat that making bad moves will still be possible.

The biggest advantage you have as the GM is that you can get feedback in real time if your players feel that the challenge is either too high, or not high enough. The easiest way of adjusting this is to increase or decrease the level of the enemies they are going to be fighting in the next combats by a few points each way, until it feels just right.

That said, variety is more important than perfect balance. Having a couple of harder fights, and a couple of easy fights, is actually looked at more fondly than the same number of "mathematically balanced" fights. As you play the game, you'll get better and better at dialing this in.
:
*Remember that "Making sure everyone is having a good time" applies to the story that everyone is telling, too. Please make sure that the people at your table aren't getting excessively uncomfortable with the subject matter. Work with your players to find the point where everyone is having the most fun, and be respectful of your player's reactions. A full description of "Lines and Veils" and "X-Cards" are beyond the scope of this guide, but cleanly slot into any Roleplaying system if you need a place to get started.*

## Encounters and Mini-Encounters

Before making specific enemies to deal with, it is more important to know how to design a map that is interesting to explore. When balanced correctly, an entire floor of a cave or an enemy castle can be represented by one encounter. This can be done by breaking the battlefield down into **Mini-Encounters** of 3 enemies.

First, choose a map that represents the area that combat might be taking place in. Then, roughly select the broad areas that the enemies would be set up. Don't chose specific enemies yet, or even specific squares, just the rough areas that they would be. Then, go through all of the areas, placing enemies down 3 at a time in **Unbalanced Clusters** of **Mini-Encounters**. Choose two of the following encounter types, and make two enemies of one subtype, and one enemy of another subtype.

- Weapon Color
  - Red
  - Green
  - Blue
  - Grey
- Role
  - High **Might** and **SPD**
  - High **Might** and **CON**
  - High **Might** and **WIS**
  - High **CON** and **WIS**
  - Healing Magics
- Range
  - Melee
  - Ranged
  - Mixed
- Damage Type
  - Physical
  - Magical

So, if making an encounter where "Color" and "Range" matter, Make sure to include "two red Enemies and one blue Enemy", and then "two range 1 enemies and one range 2 enemy". They can be of three different roles, or all the same role, and can even be all of the same damage type.

For example a "Swordmaster (Red Melee), Fire Mage (Red Mixed), and Soldier (Blue Melee)" Makes an encounter that has many different approaches to solving. "Three Swordmasters" ends to only have one solution: The highest defense blue player deals with the situation.
:
*Remember, these are the rules for making balanced medium-difficulty encounters. Sometimes, a room filled with Red Swordmasters exists to give the Blue Lancer Player a powerful moment, and not a challenge. Be judicious in breaking this rule, but don't be afraid to break it.*
:
Roughly speaking, a Mini-Encounter covers anywhere from 12-15 squares on a map. If an area is about 24-30 squares big, Place two mini encounters in the area. They can be the same or different, they are completely independent for setup.

Adding more enemies to a mini-encounter makes things harder, and expanding the area that a mini-encounter covers makes things easier. Use this to balance the game to yours and your players taste.
\page
## Designing Enemies

All enemies follow the rules of player creation. Chose an enemies Growth and Class points, choose a weapon they would have access to, and level the enemy to match the player's level.

That said, to tune the encounter difficulty, you don't invest all of your points for every enemy type. Define an enemy's quality, and leave the recommended number of points unspent:

| Quality   | Growth   | Class   |
| ---       | ---      | ---     |
| Weak      | 25 (-10) | 15 (-5) |
| Average   | 30 (-5)  | 17 (-3) |
| Dangerous | 35 (0)   | 20 (0)  |

At the lower levels of your adventure, say 1-10, the enemies should be made up of mostly weak combatants, with Average enemies carefully representing things like enemy commanders. After level 10, often average enemies can be used as common enemies, with "Dangerous" enemies representing enemy commanders. At Levels over 40, Dangerous enemies can be commonly interspersed into enemy ranks.

## Special Bosses

Sometimes, you want a big set-piece monster to deal with. This creature counts as an entire mini-encounter by itself. In order to make one, design a regular enemy like normal, and then do the following:

1. Double it's Max HP.
1. Give the creature two different attacks (of either two different colors, or two different damage types)
1. When the creature takes it's turn, it may make two different attacks against two different targets. The "ride" skill would let the creature move between attacks, without it the creature would need to position itself correctly. The attack that the creature uses last is what it **Ripostes** and **Follow Through Ripostes** with.

## Enemy equipment

Enemies choose equipment, just like players. That said, some enemies don't make sense to be fighting with tools, like wild animals. In that case, consider the following "equipment" options instead.
:
*These should be balanced for player use, should the situation arise. Consider giving a "Martial Artist" a "Claw" attack, or allowing a dragon creature type to get a Bite.*
\column
### Claw / Hoof

A Claw or Hoof is a strike with a creature's limb. These tend to have a mix of power and damage behind it. Hoves trade accuracy for critical chance, at 5 per weapon level.

|Tier | Level | Metal      | Type     | Color | Might | Accuracy | Range |
|:--- | :---  | :---       | :---     | :---  | ---:  | ---:     | :---  |

| S+  | 7     | Orichalcum | Physical | Green | 22    | 35       | 1     |

### Bite / Gore

A Bite or Gore attack is done with the creature's head. It's a risky maneuver, but the creature can put it's full weight behind it. A gore trades 5 accuracy per level for 1 damage per level.

|Tier | Level | Metal      | Type     | Color | Might | Accuracy | Range |
|:--- | :---  | :---       | :---     | :---  | ---:  | ---:     | :---  |

| S+  | 7     | Orichalcum | Physical | Red   | 28    | 5        | 1     |

### Sting / Punch

Stings are thin, piercing weapons used by creatures. They have a high amount of precision. If the thrusts has a blunt end, it's a punch and trades 1 damage per level for 5 Accuracy per level.

|Tier | Level | Metal      | Type     | Color | Might | Accuracy | Range |
|:--- | :---  | :---       | :---     | :---  | ---:  | ---:     | :---  |
| E   | 1     | Copper     | Physical | Blue  | 4     | 95       | 1     |

### Slam

Slam attacks are performed with the creature's body, or sometimes with a heavy appendage like a tail.

|Tier | Level | Metal      | Type     | Color | Might | Accuracy | Range |
|:--- | :---  | :---       | :---     | :---  | ---:  | ---:     | :---  |

| A   | 5     | Silvered   | Physical | Grey  | 11    | 50       | 1     |
| S   | 6     | Gilded     | Physical | Grey  | 13    | 40       | 1     |
| S+  | 7     | Orichalcum | Physical | Grey  | 16    | 30       | 1     |

### Magic Attacks

Some magical creatures might have magical attacks, for example a dragon's breath. In these cases, the best way to represent this is to simply choose one of the player spells, and flavor the attack as coming from the creature's nature, instead of a specific book.

This is where you let your creative muscle flex. Using the rules as given, consider the following outlines of creatures that can be made:

- Minotaur
  - Base Creature Type: Dwarf
  - Weapons: Gore, Ax
  - Stats: High **STR** and **DEF**, low **INT** and **SPD**
- Centaur
  - Base Creature Type: Human
  - Weapons: Hoof, Bow
  - Stats: High **DEX** and **SPD**, low **DEF** and **HP**
  - Skills: Ride
- Harpy
  - Base Creature Type: Carnivore
  - Weapons: Claw, Wind
  - Stats: High **WIS**
  - Skills: Fly, Sing
- Ancient Dragon (Boss Monster Option)
  - Base Creature Type: Dragon
  - Weapons: Claw, Fire
  - Stats: High **STR** and **INT**, low **SPD**
  - Skills: Fly

All you have to do is get close to the feeling of the creature. Once done, your description of the situation will carry everything the rest of the way.

If any of your creatures need to exist for more than a brief moment on screen, create one or two **Quirks** for them. If the creature isn't intelligent, then one quirk representing the creature type should suffice. If the creature is intelligent, a second quirk representing something about that particular creature can help add definition to the creature and help with roleplaying with and around it.

## Designing Traps

There are two types of traps to consider, and when including a trap in a map you need to decide which one you want to use. Quirk traps are often used more as barriers that prevent progress, and they tend to have HP and are defeated through quirk tests. These would be things like Gas traps, or rooms filling with water, or large hallways covered in pit traps.

Combat traps are a little different. Combat traps are a type of terrain, And they engage against anyone who passes over the map square it occupies. Traps have a base **Accuracy** of the traps **level**, and have a base **Might** of half the traps level. Then, the trap equips any weapon to finish off it's setup. Anyone stepping on a trapped square gets **struck** by the trap, and the trap takes no **Ripostes** or **Follow Through Ripostes** in response. For example, a Level 16 pit trap would be equipped with an Iron Slam, Have 86% **Accuracy**,  14 **Might**. The trap could be runed with a Heavy Lv2 rune, in which case it would have 16 Damage. Alternatively, the pit trap could be spiked, in which case it would be based on an Iron Lance, with 91% **Accuracy** and 20 **Might** with that heavy Rune. This would be Blue colored, though, so the triangle still applies.
