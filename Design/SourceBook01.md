# Chapter 1 - About the Game
Who would you like to be; the personal bodyguard of a prince, setting out with him to find and rescue his long-lost father? Or maybe you want to be a sickly mage that, while traveling with a group of merchants, gets conscripted into the army and forced to fight for a cause you don’t believe in. Whatever you chose, your character will experience great adventure, epic battles, and even personal growth.

## Basic Rules
Overall, the game play itself is very simple. All characters have a collection of stats that represent how well they can perform. Using these stats, you will roll dice and determine how effective you were at that given moment.

### Rolling
Adelphia is a **Roll Under** system. Each player should have access to two ten sided dice. Except in one instance, you will be rolling the two ten sided dice to generate a random number between 0% and 99%. This is done by designating one of the two dice as the tens digit, and the other as the ones digit. You roll both dice, and read the result as a percentile. For example, a roll of 4 on the tens die and a 7 on the ones die is a 47%. A roll of a double zero, 00%, is therefore the best roll available, being the lowest roll possible. In formulas given later in the book, this process is abbreviated to **d%**, meaning roll the two 10 sided dice and use the percentile reading.

The other Instance of dice rolling is used when leveling up your character. Instead of reading the two ten sided dice as a single percentage, you will add the numbers together and use the total. So in the previous example, the 4 and the 7 would be worth a total of 11. You are still rolling under, again making a roll of double zero, 0 + 0, the best roll available. This is often abbreviated as **2d10**.

> *If you ever exactly roll the number you are trying to beat, that traditionally counts as a successful roll. If two rolls are opposing each other, a tie breaks in the direction of the character that is initiating action, and against the person defending against action. If two different people are "initiating", then break in the direction of the players over NPCs.*

### Attack Tests
All weapons have a listed **Range** and **Might**. To attack an opponent, you simply move your character within your equipped weapon’s Range and declare that you are performing an attack. Your target's **Dodge** stat is subtracted from your **Accuracy** stat, and that figured value is your **Hit Chance**. If your **d%** rolls under your Hit Chance, your attack succeeds and you damage your opponent. Otherwise, your attack fails and no damage is dealt.

When performing an Attack, you will also have a **Critical** chance, and your opponent will have an **Evade** Chance. Like your Hit Chance, your **Crit Chance** is the difference between these two values. if your **d%** roll from before also Rolls Under your Crit Chance, your attack is considered a critical hit, and deals Three times the damage it normally would.

Your weapon will determine what type of damage you deal, but traditionally it will be a flat value of either your **Strength** base stat plus your weapon's **Might**, reduced by your opponent's **Constitution**. Magic attacks will be your **Intelligence** base stat plus your weapon's **Might**, reduced by your opponent's **Wisdom**.

### Stat Tests
Usually, Skill Tests are used to activate "Combat Skills". To check against a skill, you attempt a **d%** roll against your own **Base Stats**. In this case, your **Hit Chance** is the actual value of your Base Stat. Rolling under your stat means a successful test, and your Combat skill is performed. Some Tests will apply a *2 or a *1/2 modifier. Multiply your stat by this value (and round down) to get your Hit Chance. For game speed, you can use the **d%** roll for your Attack Test to pass a Stat Test. As long as your **d%** beats both, your attack works and your combat skill goes off.

### Aspects Tests
while the total number of **Aspects** may change depending on the type of campaign that is being run, traditionally your character will have four. Whenever you wish to perform an action outside of combat, you are going to choose one of these aspects to represent your familiarity with the task. Then, you will choose one of your **Base Stats** to represent how you are going about the task. Add Your level, your Stat, and a flat "100" together to determine your check **Accuracy**, and then subtract off the tasks **Difficulty** to get your **Hit Chance** for that Skill Check. If your **d%** rolls under your Hit Chance, you successfully accomplish the task you set out to perform.

If your **d%** roll would also pass a Luck Stat test, your Aspect Test is critically successful. Storyline related, something unusually lucky happens during this task.

### Leveling Up
Every significant combat increases your character's level by one. All base stats have a **Potential** to increase each level. To perform the level up, roll **2d10** against every **Base Stat** and see if you Roll Under that base stat's Potential. If you are successful, that stat increases by one point.

### Conflicting Rules
All of the rules listed here are for basic reference. Often times you might have abilities or weapons that override these basic rules, like a weapon that deals damage based on your **Dexterity**. In all cases, the more specific rule changes the more general rule.
