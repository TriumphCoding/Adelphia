# Chapter 3 - Character Creation

In addition to these basic rules, your **Game Master** may have specific guidelines she would like you to follow, or she may have even overwritten parts of this book herself. As with all pen and paper RPGs, work with the people at your table to make sure that everyone is on the same page about the types of characters that your game will support.
>*You may wish to review the sections on classes, combat, combat skills, out of combat, and equipment when making your character. Doing so can help guide you toward the type of character you wish to create.*

## Overview

In order to create a character, you are going to be performing the following steps:

1. Assign your **Growth Points**
1. Assign your **Class Points**
1. Choose your **Creature Type**
1. **Level Up** to level 1.
1. Choose your **Starting Equipment**
1. Figure your **Calculated Stats**
1. Choose your Character's final details

Once everyone has finished making their character, you are ready to start playing.

## Growth Points

Your character's **Growth** determines how each of your character's stats will change over time. Every base stat (excluding **Movement**) starts at the minimum Growth rate of "5". Then, you can spend up to 35 points raising each of these growth rates (again, excluding **Movement**). As an Example:

### Monico Aaronway Growth

| Stat      | Base   | Growth | Total  |
| :---      | ---:   | ---:   | ---:   |
| HP        | 5      | 5      | 10     |
| STR       | 5      | 6      | 11     |
| INT       | 5      | 1      | 6      |
| DEX       | 5      | 7      | 12     |
| SPD       | 5      | 6      | 11     |
| LUK       | 5      | 5      | 10     |
| CON       | 5      | 3      | 8      |
| WIS       | 5      | 2      | 7      |
| MOV       | N/A    | N/A    | N/A    |
| **Total** | **40** | **35** | **75** |

## Class Points

Your character's **Class** is what determines your character's stats right now. Your character's **Hit Points** start off at 10, and your character's **Movement** starts off at 5. All other stats start off at 2. In addition, not every stat is worth the same amount in combat. **HP** is purchased at a rate of 3 HP per point. **Luck** is purchased at 2 LUK per point. And MOV takes 2 points to increase once. Overall, you have 20 points to spend on your class. As an example:

### Monico Aaronway Stats

| Stat      | Base | Rate | Spent  | Gained | Total             |
| :---      | ---: | ---: | ---:   | ---:   | ---:              |
| HP        | 10   | x3   | 2      | +6     | 10 + 6 = **16**   |
| STR       | 2    | x1   | 4      | +4     | 2 + 4 = **6**     |
| INT       | 2    | x1   | 0      | +0     | 2 + 0 = **2**     |
| DEX       | 2    | x1   | 4      | +4     | 2 + 4 = **6**     |
| SPD       | 2    | x1   | 4      | +4     | 2 + 4 = **6**     |
| LUK       | 2    | x2   | 2      | +4     | 2 + 4 = **6**     |
| CON       | 2    | x1   | 2      | +2     | 2 + 2 = **4**     |
| WIS       | 2    | x1   | 0      | +0     | 2 + 0 = **2**     |
| MOV       | 5    | x0.5 | 2      | +1     | 5 + 1 = **6**     |
| **Total** |      |      | **20** |        |                   |

However, you may not want to follow our example character so closely, because in addition to spending points on your Starting Character stats, you can also purchase **Class Skills**. But don't worry too much, as you'll get more Class points as you **level up**.

## Class Skills

You can spend your **Class Points** on skills that might be relevant to your character, and truly set them apart from everyone else. Each skill costs a certain number of Class Points. Simply spend the points to activate the Class Skill, and you can have as many as you can afford.

>While all of these class skills are named and themed, don't feel beholden to their exact flavor. Taking **Ride** might mean your character moves uncannily quickly, or **Fly** might mean your character has access to some magic and not necessarily wings. Use what makes sense for you, and the setting you are in.

### Nobility

*Cost: 4* - Your family line has a history, and you have the potential to grow into that history. Get +1 to all your Growth Rates.

### Ride

*Cost: 4* - You are trained in riding a horse, and can put your enhanced mobility to good use in the field. You can spend unspent movement after performing an action each turn.

### Fly

*Cost: 4* - You are trained in moving through the air, and can move in ways a grounded person cannot. You ignore all terrain movement costs, and can fly over most impassable terrain. *Please work with your GM about what constitutes flight indoors*

### Armored

*Cost: 2* - You are trained in the use of Heavy Armor, and are a mobile battlefield wall. Gain +4 CON, +3 HP, -1 MOV, +1 HP Growth, +2 CON Growth.

### Runed

*Cost: 2* - You are trained in the use of Protective Runes, and are otherwise magically shielded. Gain +4 WIS, +3 HP, -1 MOV, +1 HP Growth, +2 WIS Growth.

### Sing

*Cost: 3* - You can inspire your allies around you to action. You can spend your action performing for one of your allies that has already taken their action [**Range 1**]. They recover all spent movement and may take another turn, as though it was the start of their turn again. (They can take their second turn any time during this allied phase).

### Combat Skill

*Cost: 3* - You have trained in a specialized form of combat, and you gain 1 **Combat Skill Point**. See the section on combat skills for what you can spend this on. You can purchase this background as many times as you'd like.

### Weapon Skill

*Cost: 2* - You have trained in more than a single form of self defense. Every character has access to one weapon type for free. However, if you would like to wield additional weapons categories, you will need to purchase this skill. You can purchase this background as many times as you'd like

## Creature Type

Creature Types add a little bit of fantasy flavor to your setting. Work with your GM to see if this list has been changed or customized for the setting you are using. If you prefer a lower fantasy, there should be no problem making every character human, there will be plenty of room for differentiation elsewhere. These replace the "base" values in the above creation examples.

### Human

Humans are the base to which all other creatures compare. They lean in into whatever interests them the most, and are highly adaptable.

|Human   | HP | STR | INT | DEX | SPD | LUK | DEF | RES | MOV |
|---     | ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|
| Base   |  10|    2|    2|    2|    2|    2|    2|    2|    5|
| Growth |   5|    5|    5|    5|    5|    5|    5|    5|  N/A|

### Elf

Elves move quickly and gracefully, and tend to need to avoid danger instead of taking it head on.

|Elf     | HP | STR | INT | DEX | SPD | LUK | DEF | RES | MOV |
|---     | ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|
| Base   |   7|    2|    2|    3|    4|    2|    0|    2|    5|
| Growth |   4|    5|    5|    7|    6|    5|    3|    5|  N/A|

### Dwarf

Dwarves are stout and hearty. They tend to be direct with their problem solving, for both their good and their ill.

|Dwarf   | HP | STR | INT | DEX | SPD | LUK | DEF | RES | MOV |
|---     | ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|
| Base   |  13|    2|    0|    2|    1|    2|    3|    3|    5|
| Growth |   6|    5|    3|    5|    4|    5|    6|    6|  N/A|

### Orc

Orcs are more muscle than anything else. Even so, they tend to find themselves with the short end of the stick more than they rightly deserve.

|Orc     | HP | STR | INT | DEX | SPD | LUK | DEF | RES | MOV |
|---     | ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|
| Base   |  10|    4|    2|    1|    2|    0|    2|    2|    5|
| Growth |   5|    6|    5|    4|    5|    5|    5|    5|  N/A|

### Goblin

Goblins are clever creatures, and when dedicated to a task can find themselves amongst its greatest masters. That is if they can live long enough to put in the time.

|Goblin  | HP | STR | INT | DEX | SPD | LUK | DEF | RES | MOV |
|---     | ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|
| Base   |   7|    2|    2|    3|    4|    2|    1|    1|    5|
| Growth |   4|    5|    5|    6|    7|    5|    4|    4|  N/A|

### Cyborg

Some or all of your physical body has been replaced with machinery that runs on Magic, or something even more exotic like steam. How much of your old personality survived the process is up to you to decide.

|Cyborg  | HP | STR | INT | DEX | SPD | LUK | DEF | RES | MOV |
|---     | ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|
| Base   |  10|    4|    0|    2|    2|    2|    3|    1|    5|
| Growth |   5|    6|    5|    4|    5|    5|    5|    5|  N/A|

### Carnivore

One of your ancestors made a pact with the spirit of a carnivorous animal. the remnants of that pact remains in you, with your animalistic attitude and appearance. Which animal it was is up to you.
>Animal Characters can be as animalistic or as humanoid as you prefer. Work with your GM to determine what makes the most sense in the setting.

|Carnivore| HP | STR | INT | DEX | SPD | LUK | DEF | RES | MOV |
|---      | ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|
| Base    |  10|    4|    3|    2|    3|    2|    2|    0|    5|
| Growth  |   5|    7|    3|    5|    6|    5|    5|    4|  N/A|

### Herbivore

One of your ancestors made a pact with the spirit of a herbivorous animal. the remnants of that pact remains in you, with your animalistic attitude and appearance. Which animal it was is up to you.

|Herbivore| HP | STR | INT | DEX | SPD | LUK | DEF | RES | MOV |
|---      | ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|
| Base    |  10|    2|    2|    2|    3|    2|    0|    1|    6|
| Growth  |   5|    5|    5|    5|    7|    5|    4|    4|  N/A|

### Dragon

You have dragon blood, and it manifests itself in you in interesting ways.

|Dragon  | HP | STR | INT | DEX | SPD | LUK | DEF | RES | MOV |
|---     | ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|  ---|
| Base   |  10|    2|    4|    2|    1|    2|    2|    3|    4|
| Growth |   5|    5|    7|    5|    3|    4|    5|    6|  N/A|

### Custom

If there is an idea for a player creature type that isn't on this list, feel free to choose one of the base creature types and flavor it differently. If that doesn't get the point across, a safe bet for a custom creature type is to follow the point rules, and adjust the human base points up and down, keeping the net base point value neutral.
>Be careful going more than 5 points of adjustment, though, or more than a +/- 3 to a particular stat base or growth. As always, work with your DM when performing custom plans not covered in this book.

## Choosing Equipment

All characters start the game with the following:

1. A Rank D Weapon
1. A Rank E Weapon
1. A Pouch of healing herbs

## Leveling Up

Once you've made all of your decisions, and have assigned all of your points, it's time to roll to see your first level.

For each stat with a growth, roll 2d10 and add them together. Do remember that the 10 sided dice goes from 0-9, not 1-10, to keep reading them consistent across both the d% and the 2d10 rolls. As long as you roll under that stat's growth, increase your stat by 1 point. Ties work out in your favor.

For example:

### Monico Aaronway Levelup

| Stat      | Growth | Roll | Gain   | Stat | Final |
| ---       | ---:   | ---: | ---:   | ---: | ---:  |
| HP        | 10     | 9    | +1     | 16   | **17**|
| STR       | 11     | 8    | +1     | 6    | **7** |
| INT       | 6      | 18   | +1     | 2    | **3** |
| DEX       | 12     | 13   | +0     | 6    | 6     |
| SPD       | 11     | 10   | +1     | 6    | **7** |
| LUK       | 10     | 10   | +1     | 6    | **7** |
| CON       | 8      |  9   | +0     | 4    | 4     |
| WIS       | 7      |  0   | +1     | 2    | **3** |
| MOV       | N/A    | N/A  | +0     | 6    | 6     |
| **Total** |        |      | **+6** |      |       |

### Optional Level Up Rules

Sometimes, the randomness of a level up system can feel oppressive. To help mitigate this, consider some of the following changes:

**No Bad Levels**: After rolling your stats, if you didn't gain at least 3 increases, start rerolling the stats you didn't get until you get at least 3 increases. Start rerolling from HP and work your way down the list of missed stats. Once you hit 3 total stat increases, don't continue.

**No Bad Stats**: Every time you finish a level up, if you didn't gain a particular stat, increase your growth in that stat by 1. Once you do gain that stat, reset your growth back to your base growth rate.

**Static Levels**: Instead of rolling your stats, you gain your growth as stat experience points. Once you get 18 points or more in a single stat, drop your exp by 18, and increase that stat by 1.
>*Often times, this can be useful to create a character over level 1, without rolling thousands of dice. Use {Growth} x {Starting Level} / 18 to determine how many stat growths you received over those levels, and then continue using the level up system of your choice. Always round down, regardless of how high the decimal portion is.*

## Character Creation Example

Monico Aaronway is a Human Vagabond, traveling the land in search of adventure and fame.

## Changes by Level

As your level increases, you may gain more than just stat points. You also gain skill points, and your equipment may improve. These growths happen at regular intervals, see the below table for an explanation.

|Level | Tier       | Growth Points | Stat Points | Skill Points | Weapon Level | Rune Strength | Great Skills |
| :--- | :---       | ---:          | ---:        | ---:         | ---:         | ---:          | ---:         |
