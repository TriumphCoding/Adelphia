# Chapter 3 - Character Creation
In addition to these basic rules, your **Game Master** may have specific guidelines she would like you to follow, or she may have even overwritten parts of this book herself. As with all pen and paper RPGs, work with the people at your table to make sure that everyone is on the same page about the types of characters that your game will support.
>*You may wish to review the sections on classes, combat, combat skills, out of combat, and equipment when making your character. Doing so can help guide you toward the type of character you wish to create.*

## Overview
In order to create a character, you are going to be performing the following steps:
1. Assign your **Growth Points**
1. Assign your **Class Points**
1. Choose your **Creature Type**
1. **Level Up** to level 1.
1. Choose your **Starting Equipment**
1. Figure your **Calculated Stats**
1. Choose your Character's final details

Once everyone has finished making their character, you are ready to start playing.

## Growth Points
Your character's **Growth** determines how each of your character's stats will change over time. Every base stat (excluding **Movement**) starts at the minimum Growth rate of "5". Then, you can spend up to 35 points raising each of these growth rates (again, excluding **Movement**). As an Example:

>*Monico Aaronway*
>| Stat      | Base   | Growth | Total  |
>| ---       | ---:   | ---:   | ---:   |
>| HP        | 5      | 5      | 10     |
>| STR       | 5      | 6      | 11     |
>| INT       | 5      | 1      | 6      |
>| DEX       | 5      | 7      | 12     |
>| SPD       | 5      | 6      | 11     |
>| LUK       | 5      | 5      | 10     |
>| CON       | 5      | 3      | 8      |
>| WIS       | 5      | 2      | 7      |
>| MOV       | N/A    | N/A    | N/A    |
>| **Total** | **40** | **35** | **75** |

## Class Points
Your character's **Class** is what determines your character's stats right now. Your character's **Hit Points** start off at 10, and your character's **Movement** starts off at 5. All other stats start off at 2. In addition, not every stat is worth the same amount in combat. HP is purchased at a rate of 3HP per point. **Luck** is purchased at 2 LUK per point. And MOV takes 2 points to increase once. Overall, you have 20 points to spend on your class. As an example:
>*Monico Aaronway*
>| Stat      | Base | Rate | Spent  | Gained | Total |
>| ---       | ---: | ---: | ---:   | ---:   | ---:  |
>| HP        | 10   | 3    | 2      | 6      | 16    |
>| STR       | 2    | 1    | 4      | 4      | 6     |
>| INT       | 2    | 1    | 0      | 0      | 2     |
>| DEX       | 2    | 1    | 4      | 4      | 6     |
>| SPD       | 2    | 1    | 4      | 4      | 6     |
>| LUK       | 2    | 2    | 2      | 4      | 6     |
>| CON       | 2    | 1    | 2      | 2      | 4     |
>| WIS       | 2    | 1    | 0      | 0      | 3     |
>| MOV       | 5    | 0.5  | 2      | 1      | 6     |
>| **Total** |      |      | **20** |        |       |

However, you may not want to follow our example character so closely, because in addition to spending points on your Starting Character stats, you can also purchase **Class Skills**. But don't worry too much, as you'll get more Class points as you **level up**.

## Class Skills
You can spend your **Class Points** on skills that might be relevant to your character, and truly set them apart from everyone else. Each skill costs a certain number of Class Points. Simply spend the points to activate the Class Skill, and you can have as many as you can afford.

>While all of these class skills are named and themed, don't feel beholden to their exact flavor. Taking **Ride** might mean your character moves uncannily quickly, or **Fly** might mean your character has access to some magic and not necessarily wings. Use what makes sense for you, and the setting you are in.

### Nobility
*Cost: 4* - Your family line has a history, and you have the potential to grow into that history. Get +1 to all your Growth Rates.

### Ride
*Cost: 4* - You are trained in riding a horse, and can put your enhanced mobility to good use in the field. You can spend unspent movement after performing an action each turn.

### Fly
*Cost: 4* - You are trained in moving through the air, and can move in ways a grounded person cannot. You ignore all terrain movement costs, and can fly over most impassable terrain. *Please work with your GM about what constitutes flight indoors*

### Armored
*Cost: 2* - You are trained in the use of Heavy Armor, and are a mobile battlefield wall. Gain +4 CON, +3 HP, -1 MOV, +1 HP Growth, +2 CON Growth.

### Runed
*Cost: 2* - You are trained in the use of Protective Runes, and are otherwise magically shielded. Gain +4 WIS, +3 HP, -1 MOV, +1 HP Growth, +2 WIS Growth.

### Sing
*Cost: 3* - You can inspire your allies around you to action. You can spend your action performing for one of your allies that has already taken their action [**Range 1**]. They recover all spent movement and may take another turn, as though it was the start of their turn again. (They can take their second turn any time during this allied phase).

### Combat Skill
*Cost: 3* - You have trained in a specialized form of combat, and you gain 1 **Combat Skill Point**. See the section on combat skills for what you can spend this on. You can purchase this background as many times as you'd like.

### Weapon Skill
*Cost: 2* - You have trained in more than a single form of self defense. Every character has access to one weapon type for free. However, if you would like to wield additional weapons categories, you will need to purchase this skill. You can purchase this background as many times as you'd like

## Creature Type
Creature Types add a little bit of fantasy flavor to your setting. Work with your GM to see if this list has been changed or customized for the setting you are using.

### Human

### Elf
### Dwarf
### Orc
### Goblin
### Cyborg
### HalfWolf
### HalfFox
