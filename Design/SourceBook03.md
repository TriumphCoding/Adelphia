# Chapter 3 - Character Creation
In addition to these basic rules, your **Game Master** may have specific guidelines she would like you to follow, or she may have even overwritten parts of this book herself. As with all pen and paper RPGs, work with the people at your table to make sure that everyone is on the same page about the types of characters that your game will support.
>*You may wish to review the sections on classes, combat, combat skills, out of combat, and equipment when making your character. Doing so can help guide you toward the type of character you wish to create.*
