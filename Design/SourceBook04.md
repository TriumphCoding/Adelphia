# Chapter 4 - Character Definition

Your characters are more than a bundle of numbers. They have personality, hobbies, and areas of interest that a simple stat line can't express. These character quirks influence how they interact with the world, and allow for a more general level of expression that many situations might call for.

When telling the game's story, many situations won't call for an application of direct force. Instead, one's experience and personality can be used to overcome those types of challenges. In these cases, you'll chose a quirk and one of your base stats, and together you will determine if you successfully overcome the challenge, or if the challenge overcomes you.

## Character Quirks

Character quirks are brief descriptions of who your character is, and what your character knows. In general, there are about 5 different types of quirks that you could name, but the specifics of those quirks are up to you.

> While it's OK to double-up, and give yourself two or more quirks of the same type, these are really here to help you get into your character's head, and assist in the "Roll Playing" part of the game. Making sure you have a couple of different types should encourage you to have a breadth to your character, and make them more interesting to bring to bear when the steel isn't swinging around.

**Vocation**: This is a description of a job your character might have, or would have if they weren't currently tied up in whatever is going on in the game's story right now. Were you a baker, or an Alchemist? Maybe you would be a translator for a bunch of traveling merchants. Maybe a noble, in charge of managing a big estate.

**Hobby**: is a pastime your character might do for fun, and is probably spending a a good bit of their currently remaining free time on. Are you into painting, or singing? Do you hand-sew cursed dolls? Maybe you hunt, or race horses?

>Depending on the hobby, there might be overlap here with your vocation, so try to remember your hobby is usually an escape from your job. Or maybe it your character's case it isn't. That's interesting to know, too.

**Interest**: Unlike a Vocation or a Hobby, an interest is usually an area of knowledge you know a surprising amount about, and go out of your way to keep up with. Do you follow the Noble Gossip, and can name every member of the kingdom's court? Do you know the difference between a regular and war scythe? Are you an expert in impractical magic, even if you're no good with a spellbook in an actual fight?

**Relationship**: Some people partially define themselves by their relationships with other people. Maybe you are a father, or an older sister. Maybe you grew up in an orphanage? Maybe your relationship is to yourself, and the person you used to be? Did you have to leave a former teammate behind?

**Other**: Sometimes, something character defining doesn't fit cleanly into the above categories. That's OK, as long as it's useful as a guide to who you are. Maybe you are an anxious perfectionist in everything you do? Maybe you've learned to get around in life without one of your limbs?

>Remember, you are going to be choosing more than one quirk. No one thing should be the sole definition of a character. In addition, even if these are the biggest areas of your character's life and personality, they might not be the only aspects. These are guidelines, not rails.

## Using Quirks

Quirks are used to determine how your character thinks about and overcomes unique challenges that they may face. "I don't know anything about alchemy, but I was a chef before the war broke out. Making one specific potion is just like following a recipe, right? I can do that!"

To be specific, once you determine that an obstacle in the narrative has presented itself, you will choose a quirk that you believe might help out in that situation. Then, the Game master will determine how difficult the desired task would be for someone keeping up with that particular hobby, interest, etc. Finally, you will chose a method by which you will carry our your desired action, to be represented by choosing one of your particular **Base Stats**. (Do not choose HP, LUK, or MOV for this). With this, you'll roll a **quirk test** to see how well you managed to accomplish this task in the current setting.

| Difficulty Name | Difficulty Bonus |
| :---            | :---             |
| Trivial         | 100 + *stat*     |
| Easy            | 75 + *stat*      |
| Average         | 50 + *stat*      |
| Difficult       | 25 + *stat*      |
| Legendary       | 0 + *stat*       |
| Impossible      | -25 + *stat*     |

If you pass the quirk test, you accomplish, or make progress toward, your desired outcome.

### Making Progress

Sometimes, it pays to break a task down into multiple parts, allowing multiple characters to chip in and accomplish a goal. In this case, you will assign a task HP, usually some number between 2 and 12. Then, you will choose a difficulty at which you would consider progress being made toward that goal, instead of simply accomplishing the task outright. If you match the tier of difficulty, deal 2 damage against the task. for every additional tier of difficulty your quirk test would have cleared, deal an additional 1 damage.

In addition, choose an HP value for the party. for every tier of difficulty a given roll fails by, deal 1 damage to the party. Once the party is "defeated", the outcome that they didn't want occurs.

>While more information is available in the sections about running the game, as a rule of thumb the task should have about twice the HP as the party. So the party might have 2 HP for a 4 HP task, or 3 HP for a 6 HP task.

### Getting Close

Did someone fail a skill check by only one tier of difficulty? if they did, maybe someone else at the table can come up with a way that their character might be able to help. If so, they can make an attempt against the difficulty of the task (even if the way they are helping is surprisingly simple, like bringing snacks to a person doing a large amount of research). If they succeed, then the person counts as succeeding at exactly the level difficulty.
>Feel Free to make use of other narrative devices during this time, like flashing back to a swordsmanship lesson between your two characters.

Alternatively, the Game Master may offer the character a penalty in exchange for succeeding on the roll anyway. Usually, this is a narrative penalty that might cost the character progress toward a personal goal, or momentary safety, in exchange for progress now.
>For example, if trying to escape a city, your character might take the penalty of dropping a personal item, that might be used to identify them later, as a cost for making progress toward escaping right now. Or, maybe the character scaling a wall cuts their hand as they catch themselves from falling, and is at -3 Dex for the upcoming combat after they get to the top.

### Critical Success

In addition to your hard work and dedication, sometimes you just get lucky. If the number you roll on your quirk test also rolls under your **LUK** stat, you are **Critically Successful** in the situation. Note, you must succeed in general in order to be critically successful, in the case of Legendary or Impossible tasks.

If making progress toward a long term goal, you get to make two more attempts right now, with no penalty for missing. If it's an immediate goal, then something extra happens in addition to succeeding.
>While scaling a wall, you critically succeed. When you get to the top, the guards are nowhere to be found, you happened to time your ascent perfectly with their patrol route.

## Choosing Quirks

Ultimately, it is the Game Master's Choice as to how many quirks are chosen and assigned. In general, a smaller number of quirks makes playing with a larger cast of characters easier, at the cost of making each individual character a little more one dimensional.

In general, though, the recommended number of quirks is 4. The GM will choose a themed quirk for the campaign. Every character will have a quirk that ties them to the campaign together. For example, "High-Seas Privateers" or "Adventurers for Hire". Work with your GM if you have a slight modification to this quirk that would bring more of your personal characterization out, but the change should still be on theme. Afterwords, choose 3 more quirks to round your character out.
>The recommended starting quirks are a Vocation, a Hobby, and an Interest, but if you have something specific in mind don't feel tied down to those three exactly.

Non Player Characters should have 2 quirks total, one to represent who they are in the story, and one to represent something interesting about their character to add background flavor and interest.

### Example Quirk Selection

**Monico Aaronway**:

1. *Campaign*: Traveling vagabond.
1. *Hobby*: Dances, even when watched.
1. *Interest*: Elemental Magic is fascinating.
1. *Relationship*: Older sister and caretaker.

>**Monico Aaronway** is a sword-for-hire doing what she can to take care of her younger brother after their parents passed away. He inherited his father's knack for magic, and although she has no head for the stuff herself, she's been helping him study it as she bounces from place to place trying to get by. Her sword forms that she practices reminds her of the dancing lessons she was given, back in more stable times.
