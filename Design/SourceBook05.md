# Chapter 5 - Character Growth, Skills, Weapons, and Runes

Your characters are not static. Everything they do informs who they are, and what they can do. And as your character grows, they will find more than just increased stats. They will develop specialized skills, and acquire equipment worthy of their status.

## Gaining Levels

Every significant story beat grants a level up.

## Story Beats

The above is hard to explain in specific, but it should feel very natural at the table. Ultimately, these are determined by the GM, but as a rough rule of thumb, any time your characters would feel like they have accomplished something, they should level up. For example:

- Clearing out a cave filled with monsters.
- Running around a town to successfully raise a defense.
- Defending that town from the assault at the walls.
- Putting together the pieces and casting a magic ritual.
- Guard a caravan moving from point A to point B
- Escaping a city while being chased by the guards.
- Clearing out a floor of an enemy stronghold, and moving on to the next.

To execute the level up, follow the rules given in chapter 3.

## Gaining Skills

Every 5 levels, you get a skill point. Unlike your stats, which are always applied, skill points grant conditional combat bonuses, and further encourage combat differentiation. Each skill costs one skill point, and skills that have multiple levels cost one skill point per level.

You can have a total of 5 different skills equipped at a time. You may learn more than 5 skills, but if you do you can only bring 5 at a time into a given combat. Leveling a skill only takes one slot, but bringing two versions of a skill, like **Empowered Strike (STR)** and **Empowered Strike (SPD)** takes one slot each.

## Skill List

**Hearty**: Increase **Total HP** by 20%/40%/60% of your **Level**

**Cornered Strike**: Increase **STR**, **INT**, **DEX**, **SKL**, **SPD**, **CON**, or **WIS** by 10%/20%/30% of your **Level** if you are at less than 50% **Current HP**. Choose which stat you increase on purchase of the skill. You may take this multiple times for different skills.

**Controlled Strike**: Increase **STR**, **INT**, **DEX**, **SKL**, **SPD**, **CON**, or **WIS** by 10%/20%/30% of your **Level** if you are at more than 70% HP. Choose which stat you increase on purchase of the skill. You may take this multiple times for different skills.

**Empowered Strike**: Increase **STR**, **INT**, **DEX**, **SKL**, **SPD**, **CON**, or **WIS** by 10%/20%/30% of your **Level** when you **Attack** and **Follow Through Attack**. Choose which stat you increase on purchase of the skill. You may take this multiple times for different skills.

**Empowered Riposte**: Increase **STR**, **INT**, **DEX**, **SKL**, **SPD**, **CON**, or **WIS** by 10%/20%/30% of your **Level** when you **Riposte** and **Follow Through Riposte**. Choose which stat you increase on purchase of the skill. You may take this multiple times for different skills.

**Janken Mastery**: Increases **Weapon Triangle** effects by 1/2/3 levels if you are on the winning side of the weapon triangle.

**Fury**: Increase **STR**, **INT**, **DEX**, **SKL**, **SPD**, **CON**, and **WIS** by 10%/20%/30% of your **Level**, but you take 10%/20%/30% of your **Total HP** in damage after each combat you participate in. This damage can't kill you, leaving you at 1HP.

**Weapon Mastery**: You may take this skill multiple times, each time applying the skill to a new weapon type.

1. Increase the **Accuracy** of the mastered weapon by your **Level**.
1. Increase the **Might** of the master weapon by 10% of your **Level**.
1. Increase the **Critical** of the master weapon by 50% of your **Level**.

*ToDo: Add more skills, math out weapon mastery vs other skills, Add in %chance skills.*

## Gaining Weapons

As your character's level increases, the power of the weapons they have access to also increase. Every 10 levels, a new tier of weapons will be unlocked. In addition, at the 5 between those levels unlimited access to the previous tier will also be granted.

>If this sections feels a little loose in the explanation as to when you receive your weapons, it's that weaponry are physical things, and unlike skills you can be a little bit looser at the exact moment of acquisition. The narrative might grant you access to the weapon a level or two early or late. Maybe as your reward for slaying a monster threatening a town a new weapon is given to the party. That might not be exactly at level 20, and that's OK. Remember, as with all narrative aspects of the game, to work with the DM to make sure everyone is having a good time.

Roughly speaking, weapon levels follow the below schedule:

|Tier | Level | Metal     | First Acquired Level | Full Access Level
|:--- | :---  |:---       | :---                 | :---
| E   | 1     |Bronze     | 1                    | 5
| D   | 2     |Iron       | 1                    | 15
| C   | 3     |Steel      | 10                   | 25
| B   | -     |*Special*  | 20                   | 35
| A   | 5     |Silvered   | 30                   | 45
| S   | -     |*Reforged* | 40                   | 55
| S+  | 7     |Orichalcum | 50                   | 65

Taking Steel weapons as an example, at level 10 you will gain access to your first steal weapon. As your level increases, you might be able to trade out that steel weapon for others that are level appropriate, but you won't be able to fill out an arsenal of steel weapons. At level 25, you will roughly have access to the resources to swap out any steel weapon basically at will, as long as the narrative supports your access to these weapons.

**Special Weapons** and **Reforged Weapons** aren't tiers in and of themselves. Special weapons instead have unique effects that aren't commonly accessible at weapon tiers. These weapons are unique, and could be at any tier in terms of stats. At 55, you get the ability to reforge these abilities of any special weapons into a weapon tier of your choice, including across weapon types.

## Weapon Types

Weapon types are separated into two different types of categorization plans. **Physical Weapons** are weapons wielded by your **STR** and defended by your target's **CON**, and **Magic Weapons** are wielded by your **INT** and defended by your target's **WIS**. In addition, weapons are assigned a color: **Red** weapons are more effective against **Green** weapons, **Green** weapons are more effective against **Blue** weapons, and **Blue** weapons are more effective against **Red** weapons. **Grey** weapons are neutral in all combats. On character creation, everyone gets to choose one weapon type that they are familiar with. You can't wield a weapon type you are unfamiliar with.

Some weapons have multiple sub-categories, for example a **Katana** is a type of **Sword**. All subtypes are minor variations of the base type of weapon. When equipping a sub-type, use the stats of the main-type weapon, then apply the sub-type changes to it.

### Sword

Swords are the standard fantasy weapon. They are useful in most situations, and you'll never really go wrong with having one by your side.

A **Katana** is a type of sword that encourages quickness and speed over defense. Wielding a Katana increases your **SPD** by 1 and decreases your **CON** and **WIS** by 1 per weapon level.

|Tier | Level | Metal      | Color | Might | Accuracy | Range
|:--- | :---  | :---       | :---  |---:  | ---:     | :---

### Axe

Axes hurt people. The preferred weapon of brigands and mercenaries, Axes pack a wallop that nothing else can quite compare to. Their power is somewhat dwarfed by their difficulty to wield accurately.

A **Club** is wielded like a blunt Axe, bludgeoning instead of cutting your opponent. A club increases your **Critical** by 5 and decreases your **STR** by 1 per weapon level.

|Tier | Level | Metal      | Color | Might | Accuracy | Range

| C   | 3     | Steel      | Green | 12    | 65       | 1
| A   | 5     | Silvered   | Green | 20    | 35       | 1
| S+  | 7     | Orichalcum | Green | 28    | 5        | 1

### Lance

Lances are a soldier's weapon. They split the difference between the accuracy of the sword and the power of the axe.

A **Naginata** is a type of lance that encourages defense over offense. Wielding a Naginata increases your **CON** and **WIS** and decreases your **STR** and **INT** by 1 per weapon level.

| A   | 5     | Silvered   | Blue  | 16    | 55       | 1

| S+  | 7     | Orichalcum | Grey  | 13    | 50       | 1

### Crossbow

Easy to Hold and aim, crossbows are utilitarian weapons that are as deadly as they are efficient. Thier range provides a safety that really can't be beat.

An **Arbalest** is a heavy type of crossbow that sacrifices speed for power. Increase **STR** and **INT** and decrease your **SPD** by 1 per weapon level.

### Shuriken

Shuriken are deadly pointed stars of metal that are deadly, if difficult to work with. Their safety and power from range makes them the formidable weapon they are.

**Knives** trade the power of a shuriken for the versatility of range. Decrease **STR** and **INT** by 1 per level, but all knives are range 1-2, instead of simply range 2.
