# Chapter 5 - Character Growth, Skills and Equipment

Your characters are not static. Everything they do informs who they are, and what they can do. And as your character grows, they will find more than just increased stats. They will develop specialized skills, and acquire equipment worthy of their status.

## Gaining Levels

Every significant story beat grants a level up.

## Story Beats

The above is hard to explain in specific, but it should feel very natural at the table. Ultimately, these are determined by the GM, but as a rough rule of thumb, any time your characters would feel like they have accomplished something, they should level up. For example:

- Clearing out a cave filled with monsters.
- Running around a town to successfully raise a defense.
- Defending that town from the assault at the walls.
- Putting together the pieces and casting a magic ritual.
- Guard a caravan moving from point A to point B
- Escaping a city while being chased by the guards.
- Clearing out a floor of an enemy stronghold, and moving on to the next.

To execute the level up, follow the rules given in chapter 3.

## Gaining Skills

Every 5 levels, you get a skill point. Unlike your stats, which are always applied, skill points grant conditional combat bonuses, and further encourage combat differentiation. Each skill costs one skill point, and skills that have multiple levels cost one skill point per level.

You can have a total of 5 different skills equipped at a time. You may learn more than 5 skills, if so, you can only bring 5 at a time into a given combat.
