# Chapter 5 - Character Growth, Skills and Equipment

Your characters are not static. Everything they do informs who they are, and what they can do. And as your character grows, they will find more than just increased stats. They will develop specialized skills, and acquire equipment worthy of their status.

## Gaining Levels

Every significant story beat grants a level up.

## Story Beats

The above is hard to explain in specific, but it should feel very natural at the table. Ultimately, these are determined by the GM, but as a rough rule of thumb, any time your characters would feel like they have accomplished something, they should level up. For example:

1. Clearing out a cave filled with monsters.
1. Running around a town to successfully raise a defense.
1. Putting together the pieces and casting a magic ritual.
1. Guard a caravan moving from point A to point B
