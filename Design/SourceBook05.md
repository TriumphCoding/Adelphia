# Chapter 5 - Character Growth, Skills, Weapons, and Runes

Your characters are not static. Everything they do informs who they are, and what they can do. And as your character grows, they will find more than just increased stats. They will develop specialized skills, and acquire equipment worthy of their status.

## Gaining Levels

Every significant story beat grants a level up.

## Story Beats

The above is hard to explain in specific, but it should feel very natural at the table. Ultimately, these are determined by the GM, but as a rough rule of thumb, any time your characters would feel like they have accomplished something, they should level up. For example:

- Clearing out a cave filled with monsters.
- Running around a town to successfully raise a defense.
- Defending that town from the assault at the walls.
- Putting together the pieces and casting a magic ritual.
- Guard a caravan moving from point A to point B
- Escaping a city while being chased by the guards.
- Clearing out a floor of an enemy stronghold, and moving on to the next.

To execute the level up, follow the rules given in chapter 3.

## Gaining Skills

Every 5 levels, you get a skill point. Unlike your stats, which are always applied, skill points grant conditional combat bonuses, and further encourage combat differentiation. Each skill costs one skill point, and skills can be taken multiple times.

## Gaining Weapons

As your character's level increases, the power of the weapons they have access to also increase. Every 10 levels, a new tier of weapons will be unlocked. In addition, at the halfway point between those levels you will be granted unlimited access to the previous tier of weapons.

>If this sections feels a little loose in the explanation as to when you receive your weapons, it's that weaponry are physical things, and unlike skills you can be a little bit looser at the exact moment of acquisition. The narrative might grant you access to the weapon a level or two early or late. Maybe as your reward for slaying a monster threatening a town a new weapon is given to the party. That might not be exactly at level 20, and that's OK. Remember, as with all narrative aspects of the game, to work with the DM to make sure everyone is having a good time.

Roughly speaking, weapon levels follow the below schedule:

|Tier | Level | Metal     | First Acquired Level | Full Access Level
|:--- | :---  |:---       | :---                 | :---
| E   | 1     |Copper     | 1                    | 5
| D   | 2     |Bronze     | 1                    | 15
| C   | 3     |Iron       | 10                   | 25
| B   | 4     |Steel      | 20                   | 35
| A   | 5     |Silvered   | 30                   | 45
| S   | 6     |Gilded     | 40                   | 55
| S+  | 7     |Orichalcum | 50                   | 65

Taking Steel weapons as an example, at level 10 you will gain access to your first steal weapon. As your level increases, you might be able to trade out that steel weapon for others that are level appropriate, but you won't be able to fill out an arsenal of steel weapons. At level 25, you will roughly have access to the resources to swap out any steel weapon basically at will, as long as the narrative supports your access to these weapons.

## Weapon Cycle

Some weapons are naturally more effective when brought to bear against someone using the wrong weapon type. This is represented by the following relationship:

- **Red** weapons beat **Green** Weapons
- **Green** weapons beat **Blue** weapons
- **Blue** weapons beat **Red** weapons

If your weapon beats your opponent's, increase your **Accuracy** by 10 per weapon level, and increase your **Might** by 1 per weapon level. If your weapon loses to your opponent, instead decrease your **Might** and **Accuracy** by that same amount.

For example, if your accuracy is 87 while wielding an iron sword, and you are going to be striking a mage wielding a Bronze Thunder Spell, you would instead attack with 117 accuracy. If the mage had 91 accuracy, their riposte would instead by at 71 accuracy.

Outside of this cycle, weapons don't change. So Red weapons fighting Grey weapons don't change their **Accuracy** or **Might**. Same for a Blue weapon fighting a Blue weapon.

## Weapon Types

Weapon types are separated into two different types of categorization plans. **Physical Weapons** are weapons wielded by your **STR** and defended by your target's **CON**, and **Magic Weapons** are wielded by your **INT** and defended by your target's **WIS**. In addition, weapons are assigned a color: **Red** weapons are more effective against **Green** weapons, **Green** weapons are more effective against **Blue** weapons, and **Blue** weapons are more effective against **Red** weapons. **Grey** weapons are neutral in all combats. On character creation, everyone gets to choose one weapon type that they are familiar with. You can't wield a weapon type you are unfamiliar with.

Some weapons have multiple sub-categories, for example a **Katana** is a type of **Sword**. All subtypes are minor variations of the base type of weapon. When equipping a sub-type, use the stats of the main-type weapon, then apply the sub-type changes to it.

### Sword

Swords are the standard fantasy weapon. They are useful in most situations, and you'll never really go wrong with having one by your side.

A **Katana** is a type of sword that encourages quickness and speed over defense. Wielding a Katana increases your **SPD** by 1 and decreases your **CON** and **WIS** by 1 per weapon level.

| S+  | 7     | Orichalcum | Physical | Green | 28    | 5        | 1

### Lance

Lances are a soldier's weapon. They split the difference between the accuracy of the sword and the power of the axe.

>Magic Tomes are actually crafted books, carried around by mages. The power of the mage usually confirms how much raw power a mage can bring to bear, but without time consuming rituals and the proper foci of power it is almost impossible to bring the power of magic to bear, especially in the heat of battle. Magical Books are covered in runes that Mages push raw magic through, shaping the magic in the complex ways necessary to cast that particular spell. The inks used in these books actually contain the metals in their composition.

### Staff

Staffs are special weapons that can technically be used to send raw magical force at your enemies, however they are most often used to provide healing to your allies, and keep them fighting for you.

## Gaining Runes

In a world of fantasy and magic, Weapons can be more than simple metal tools. Placing a rune into a weapon fills it with magical properties. Like weapons, the runes that your character has access to are roughly determined by level.

|Tier | Level | Metal     | Acquired Level |
|:--- | :---  |:---       | :---           |
| D   | 1     |Bronze     | 4              |
| C   | 1     |Iron       | 8              |
| C   | 2     |Iron       | 12             |
| B   | 1     |Steel      | 16             |
| B   | 2     |Steel      | 20             |
| B   | 3     |Steel      | 24             |
| A   | 1     |Silvered   | 28             |
| A   | 2     |Silvered   | 32             |
| A   | 3     |Silvered   | 36             |
| A   | 4     |Silvered   | 40             |
| S   | 1     |Gilded     | 44             |
| S   | 2     |Gilded     | 48             |
| S   | 3     |Gilded     | 52             |
| S   | 4     |Gilded     | 56             |
| S   | 5     |Gilded     | 60             |

When choosing a weapon, you will traditionally choose a weapon metal and a rune for that metal that you meet the requirements for. Some runes get more powerful depending on the rune's level, and some runes have a minimum level requirement in order to place them. For example, if a rune requires "Level 2", you can't place one on an Iron weapon until level 12, and you can't place them on a steel weapon until level 20. You can never place that rune on a Bronze weapon. The Minimum Level requirement of the rune is listed after the rune name.
