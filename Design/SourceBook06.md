# Chapter 6 - Combat

Sometimes, fights break out, and you need to be prepared to deal with this. Combat is exciting, dangerous, and deadly. Do try not to die.

Combat seems complicated, but as long as you can break it down into all of it's steps, you will find that there is nothing that is individually that difficult

## Strike a target

In order to actually perform a strike, find your **Accuracy** and your opponent's **Dodge**. Subtract them to get your **Hit Chance**. Also find your **Critical** and your opponents **Avoid** and take the difference to get your **Crit Chance**. Last, roll your **d%**,

If you roll below your **Hit Chance**, you successfully strike your opponent. Take your **Might**, and subtract off your opponent's **Defense**. This is how much damage you manage to inflict. This does mean that you might deal 0 damage against a sufficiently armored foe. If you also managed to roll under your **Crit Chance**, you critically strike and deal 3 times the damage you would inflict with your standard attack. Again, 3 times 0 is zero.

However, most opponent's aren't going to simply stand there and take it. they will try to **Riposte**

## Engaging a Foe

When you engage with a foe to attack them, you will run through the following 4 strikes:

1. The attacker **Attacks**
1. The defender **Ripostes**
1. The attacker **Follow Through Attacks**, if available
1. The defender **Follow Through Ripostes**, if available

The person declaring the attack goes first, and attempts to strike the defender. Once that strike is resolved, if the defender is still alive they will attempt to strike back in a **Riposte**. This strike is calculated the exact same way as a regular strike, but some skills or runes might only apply to **attacks** or **ripostes**.

Then, once both the attacker and the defender have resolved their attacks and ripostes, the attackers **follow through attacks** trigger. These are any secondary attacks granted by your speed or other abilities. Last, the defender resolves any of their **follow through ripostes**.

In all engagements, a **follow through** is granted if your **SPD** is 4 greater than your opponent's **SPD**. So an attacker with 4 Speed and a defender with 1 speed will not trigger a **follow through attack**. A defender with 8 **SPD** and an attacker with 4 **SPD** will be granted a **Follow through riposte**. When that same defender declares an attack on their turn, they will be granted a **follow through attack**. Some skills or weapon runes might grant additional **Follow through** strikes. If you are granted more than 1, they all trigger in a row during the appropriate follow through phase.

## Range

All of the above assumes that everyone's weapons can actually reach. While we'll go over the grid more fully in a short bit, all weapons have a range. You can only engage with a foe at at a range supported by your weapon, and if you are engaged, you can only riposte if your weapon supports the range your enemy has chosen to engage at.

## Movement

Full Combat takes place on a square gridded combat map. Every character has a movement stat that dictates how far they can move on a turn. Traditionally, you can move as far as you want each turn, but once you perform an action your turn is over, and any unused movement is wasted. You spend 1 movement to enter a new square.

Some squares might be fortified terrain. These cost additional movement to enter, but may provide additional defensive stats.

| Terrain Type  | Movement | Defense | Dodge | HP Recovery  |
| ---           | ---      | ---     | ---   | ---          |
| Basic         | 1        | 0       | 0     | 0            |
| Light         | 2        | 1       | 10    | 0            |
| Medium        | 2        | 2       | 20    | 0            |
| Heavy         | 3        | 3       | 30    | 10           |
| Difficult (N) | N        | 0       | 0     | 0            |

For example, fighting on stairs might be considered fighting on light fortification, and getting into an arrow-slit might count as taking Medium Fortification. Characters with the **Flight** class ability only pay 1 point of movement for all terrain type movements.

Most walls block movement completely, along with most short objects and fortifications. Characters with **Flight** can end their movement on these, hovering in place, but do try to keep in mind the physics of the situation. A character with flight can't fly over indoor walls, for example.

## Actions in Combat

Traditionally, there are two actions you can take for each of your turns in combat: Move and Engage. Move lets you spend your movement points to move around the battlefield, and Engage lets you attack an enemy. Some objects might be able to be interacted with, this takes your Engagement action. Some skills allow you to interact with your allies, these also take your Engage Action.

Switching weapons that you are currently carrying is not an action. Neither are things like talking. However, some things like "catching someone up" on the situation at hand might be an action. In fact, if you need to explain a complicated plan under a time crunch, the DM might actually instigate an HP total for the explanation and make you roll skill checks. These skill checks require an engagement action.

## Combat Phases

Combat takes place in phases. Once combat has been decided upon, all participants divide into the combat sides. Under normal conditions, all players will be on one side of the combat, and all enemies will be on the other. During the **Hero Phase**, all players take turns in whatever order they feel is the most advantageous. Once everyone has spent their movement and taken their desired action, combat moves to the **Enemy Phase**.

The Game Master then takes all of the turns for the enemies, Moving and engaging as desired, until they feel that all actions have been made. The phase last returns to the **Ally Phase**

Sometimes, stakes in a combat can't be cleanly sorted into Heroes and Enemies. roughly speaking, there are 4 types of combatants:

1. The Heroes, made up of all the players in the game
1. The Enemies, those directly opposing the heroes.
1. The Allies, groups of people that may be outside the Players control, but otherwise working of the Player's benefit.
1. The Independents, groups that are present in the battlefield but otherwise have goals independent to the Players or their Enemies.

The play phase actually continues like this: The Heroes take their turns. then any enemy teams present take theirs. More than one enemy team can exist, but often there isn't a reason to manage them separately, the DM will use their judgement here. Then, any allies of the Heroes will make their moves, again the DM making their choices. Once all allies have had their turn, any independents in the field will make their move. Last, play will pass back to the Heroes, and this continues until the reason for conflict is resolved.

## Starting a Combat

Traditionally speaking, the GM will map out the area that the players can currently see, including all enemies visible. The GM will then mark out a bounding box for any of the players to place their starting characters into. This allows you to roleplay in the theater of the mind with out having to care about the combat grid until combat actually starts.

>One way of doing things is to set up the situation, draw the bounding box for the characters, and place them inside the box however they want to be placed. Then, hold off on the combat and do whatever roleplay for that scene you wish to accomplish. If the narration makes an excuse for it, a player may leave the box and walk off with an enemy, but only then does their position matter. If combat breaks out, any player outside the box is stuck in their current position, but any inside the box get to freely rearrange to start the combat.

## Finishing Combat

Usually, the Allies will have a goal in mind. Break through the enemy line. Defeat the enemy commander. Escape the town. Rescue the citizens. Combat ends when there is no enemy in a position to prevent this goal from being realized.

So for example, if the Players are trying to break into a city controlled by a corrupt leader, combat won't be engaged with. You as players will use your quirks to overcome any challenges that you might encounter. However, if a quirk test goes bad, and you are spotted, now combat itself breaks out.

IN that situation, the players will fight their way through the couple of guards that are around, and if they manage to get past them combat will drop and you will continue with the story the way it was going before. However, "Get past them" might take many different forms

- Dropping all guards HP to zero.
- Moving to the opposite side of the combat map and escaping the combat
- Using their Quirks to intimidate the guards, scaring them away.

Regardless, once combat is no longer in the way of the players, the game becomes easier to run in an entirely narrative fashion.

## Quick Combats with Zones

This is a tool for the Game Master to choose to employ, because sometimes fights break out in places that they don't have a good map for. In these cases, you can create a simple map using zones. There is no limit to the number of characters that can be in the same zone, and characters can only engage with things in their current zone. Zones are loosely connected to each other, and moving to a new zone costs 3 Movement or an Engage action.

When engaging, it is assumed to be at the **Range** that gives the attacker the most advantage. In addition, players with the **provoke** skill must be engaged with before anyone else in the zone they are currently occupying.

## Death

Whenever any character, enemy or player, loses their last point of HP, that character is removed from the current combat. Death, however, is not necessarily inevitable.

For enemies, the player landing the final blow gets to decide if that attack is lethal or not. This is mainly for roleplay purposes. Any enemy tha the GM deems significant may instead "retreat" from the combat upon losing their last point of HP, surviving to hound the players again.

For players, losing their last point of HP is an interesting situation. There are roughly 3 ways to handle this, and I would leave it up to the gaming group to determine how death is handled.

First, you could have a character losing all of their HP signify death. That character is dead, out of the game, and the player should either create a new character to be introduced, or potentially pick up the mantle of an NPC closely aligned with the players, placing that character under the player's control.

Second, you could simply only count complete party wipes as death. Simply having one person survive to the end of a combat challenge implies that everyone got through. This makes combat more abstract, but it does make people more willing to be aggressive in combat, which might be desirable.

Last, you could cut the difference, and resolve the situation kind of narrativly. If a player loses their HP, any other player can spend an "Engagement action" to stabilize the fallen character. If a character is stabilized, then they survive the encounter and can be revived later. If the players are forced to continue along without being able to perform this action, then the character is lost to the enemy, and it is up to the DM if the character is captured or dead. Regardless, the character has fallen out of the story for now, and the character's player should continue along as through the character had died.

## Multiple Characters

Each player should have their own character that they are controlling. However, the story may make it necessary to have multiple people join with the players to accomplish their goals. In that case, instead of adding an ally phase, consider allowing the players to collectively control the actions these extra characters take during combat. If there are enough of these characters, assign particular players to be responsible for them.
