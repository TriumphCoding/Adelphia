# Chapter 7 - Monsters and Traps

The world is a populous place. People, monsters, and other things exist that would hold the players from accomplishing their goals. As a Game Master, it is your job to bring these to bear against the players.

## A GMs Responsibility

As a Game Master, your responsibility is to make sure that everyone at the gaming table is having a good time. Regardless of anything else in this section, you and your players should be having fun. The biggest effect that this has is on difficulty. The advice in this section will be tuned to a Medium difficulty, designed to allow players to feel powerful, but with just enough threat that making bad moves will still be possible.

The biggest advantage you have as the GM is that you can get feedback in real time if your players feel that the challenge is either too high, or not high enough. The easiest way of adjusting this is to increase or decrease the level of the enemies they are going to be fighting in the next combats by a few points each way, until it feels just right.

That said, variety is more important than perfect balance. Having a couple of harder fights, and a couple of easy fights, is actually looked at more fondly than the same number of "mathematically balanced" fights. As you play the game, you'll get better and better at dialing this in.

>Remember that "Making sure everyone is having a good time" applies to the story that everyone is telling, too. Please make sure that the people at your table aren't getting excessively uncomfortable with your subject matter. Work with your players to find the point where everyone is having the most fun, and be respectful of your player's reactions. A full description of "Lines and Veils" and "X-Cards" are beyond the scope of this guide, but cleanly slot into any Roleplaying system if you need a place to get started.
