# Chapter 7 - Monsters and Traps

The world is a populous place. People, monsters, and other things exist that would hold the players from accomplishing their goals. As a Game Master, it is your job to bring these to bear against the players.

## A GMs Responsibility

As a Game Master, your responsibility is to make sure that everyone at the gaming table is having a good time. Regardless of anything else in this section, you and your players should be having fun. The biggest effect that this has is on difficulty. The advice in this section will be tuned to a Medium difficulty, designed to allow players to feel powerful, but with just enough threat that making bad moves will still be possible.

The biggest advantage you have as the GM is that you can get feedback in real time if your players feel that the challenge is either too high, or not high enough. The easiest way of adjusting this is to increase or decrease the level of the enemies they are going to be fighting in the next combats by a few points each way, until it feels just right.

That said, variety is more important than perfect balance. Having a couple of harder fights, and a couple of easy fights, is actually looked at more fondly than the same number of "mathematically balanced" fights. As you play the game, you'll get better and better at dialing this in.

>Remember that "Making sure everyone is having a good time" applies to the story that everyone is telling, too. Please make sure that the people at your table aren't getting excessively uncomfortable with the subject matter. Work with your players to find the point where everyone is having the most fun, and be respectful of your player's reactions. A full description of "Lines and Veils" and "X-Cards" are beyond the scope of this guide, but cleanly slot into any Roleplaying system if you need a place to get started.

## Encounters and Mini-Encounters

Before making specific enemies to deal with, it is more important to know how to design a map that is interesting to explore. When balanced correctly, an entire floor of a cave or an enemy castle can be represented by one encounter. This can be done by breaking the battlefield down into **Mini-Encounters** of 3 enemies.

First, choose a map that represents the area that combat might be taking place in. Then, roughly select the broad areas that the enemies would be set up. Don't chose specific enemies yet, or even specific squares, just the rough areas that they would be. Then, go through all of the areas, placing enemies down 3 at a time in **Unbalanced Clusters** of **Mini-Encounters**. Choose two of the following encounter types, and make two enemies of one subtype, and one enemy of another subtype.

- Weapon Color
  - Red
  - Green
  - Blue
  - Grey
- Role
  - High **Might** and **SPD**
  - High **Might** and **CON**
  - High **Might** and **WIS**
  - High **CON** and **WIS**
  - Healing Magics
- Range
  - Melee
  - Ranged
  - Mixed
- Damage Type
  - Physical
  - Magical

So, if making an encounter where "Color" and "Range" matter, Make sure to include "two red Enemies and one blue Enemy", and then "two range 1 enemies and one range 2 enemy". They can be of three different roles, or all the same role, and can even be all of the same damage type.

So, For example a "Swordmaster (Red Melee), Fire Mage (Red Mixed), and Soldier (Blue Melee)" Makes an encounter that has many different approaches to solving. "Three Swordmasters" Tends to only have one solution: The highest defense blue player deals with the situation.
