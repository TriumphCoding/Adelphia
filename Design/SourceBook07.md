# Chapter 7 - Monsters and Traps

The world is a populous place. People, monsters, and other things exist that would hold the players from accomplishing their goals. As a Game Master, it is your job to bring these to bear against the players.

## A GMs Responsibility

As a Game Master, your responsibility is to make sure that everyone at the gaming table is having a good time. Regardless of anything else in this section, you and your players should be having fun. The biggest effect that this has is on difficulty. The advice in this section will be tuned to a Medium difficulty, designed to allow players to feel powerful, but with just enough threat that making bad moves will still be possible.

The biggest advantage you have as the GM is that you can get feedback in real time if your players feel that the challenge is either too high, or not high enough. The easiest way of adjusting this is to increase or decrease the level of the enemies they are going to be fighting in the next combats by a few points each way, until it feels just right.

That said, variety is more important than perfect balance. Having a couple of harder fights, and a couple of easy fights, is actually looked at more fondly than the same number of "mathematically balanced" fights. As you play the game, you'll get better and better at dialing this in.

>Remember that "Making sure everyone is having a good time" applies to the story that everyone is telling, too. Please make sure that the people at your table aren't getting excessively uncomfortable with the subject matter. Work with your players to find the point where everyone is having the most fun, and be respectful of your player's reactions. A full description of "Lines and Veils" and "X-Cards" are beyond the scope of this guide, but cleanly slot into any Roleplaying system if you need a place to get started.

## Encounters and Mini-Encounters

Before making specific enemies to deal with, it is more important to know how to design a map that is interesting to explore. When balanced correctly, an entire floor of a cave or an enemy castle can be represented by one encounter. This can be done by breaking the battlefield down into **Mini-Encounters** of 3 enemies.

First, choose a map that represents the area that combat might be taking place in. Then, roughly select the broad areas that the enemies would be set up. Don't chose specific enemies yet, or even specific squares, just the rough areas that they would be. Then, go through all of the areas, placing enemies down 3 at a time in **Unbalanced Clusters** of **Mini-Encounters**. Choose two of the following encounter types, and make two enemies of one subtype, and one enemy of another subtype.

- Weapon Color
  - Red
  - Green
  - Blue
  - Grey
- Role
  - High **Might** and **SPD**
  - High **Might** and **CON**
  - High **Might** and **WIS**
  - High **CON** and **WIS**
  - Healing Magics
- Range
  - Melee
  - Ranged
  - Mixed
- Damage Type
  - Physical
  - Magical

So, if making an encounter where "Color" and "Range" matter, Make sure to include "two red Enemies and one blue Enemy", and then "two range 1 enemies and one range 2 enemy". They can be of three different roles, or all the same role, and can even be all of the same damage type.

So, For example a "Swordmaster (Red Melee), Fire Mage (Red Mixed), and Soldier (Blue Melee)" Makes an encounter that has many different approaches to solving. "Three Swordmasters" Tends to only have one solution: The highest defense blue player deals with the situation.

>Remember, these are the rules for making balanced medium-difficulty encounters. Sometimes, a room filled with Red Swordmasters exists to give the Blue Lancer Player a powerful moment, and not a challenge. Be judicious in breaking this rule, but don't be afraid to break it.

Roughly speaking, a Mini-Encounter covers anywhere from 12-15 squares on a map. If an area is about 24-30 squares big, Place two mini encounters in the area. They can be the same or different, they are completely independent for setup.

Adding more enemies to a mini-encounter makes things harder, and expanding the area that a mini-encounter covers makes things easier. Use this to balance the game to yours and your players taste.

## Designing Enemies

All enemies follow the rules of player creation. Chose an enemies Growth and Class points, choose a weapon they would have access to, and level the enemy to match the player's level.

That said, to tune the encounter difficulty, you don't invest all of your points for every enemy type. Define an enemy's quality, and leave the recommended number of points unspent:

| Quality   | Growth   | Class   |
| ---       | ---      | ---     |
| Weak      | 25 (-10) | 15 (-5) |
| Average   | 30 (-5)  | 17 (-3) |
| Dangerous | 35 (0)   | 20 (0)  |

At the lower levels of your adventure, say 1-10, the enemies should be made up of mostly weak combatants, with Average enemies carefully representing things like enemy commanders. After level 10, often average enemies can be used as common enemies, with "Dangerous" enemies representing enemy commanders. At Levels over 40, Dangerous enemies can be commonly interspersed into enemy ranks.

## Special Bosses

Sometimes, you want a big set-piece monster to deal with. This creature counts as an entire mini-encounter by itself. In order to make one, design a regular enemy like normal, and then do the following:

1. Double it's Max HP.
1. Give the creature two different attacks (of either two different colors, or two different damage types)
1. When the creature takes it's turn, it may make two different attacks against two different targets. The "ride" skill would let the creature move between attacks, without it the creature would need to position itself correctly. The attack that the creature uses last is what it **Ripostes** and **Follow Through Ripostes** with.

## Enemy equipment

Enemies choose equipment, just like players. That said, some enemies don't make sense to be fighting with tools, like wild animals. In that case, consider the following "equipment" options instead.

>These should be balanced for player use, should the situation arise. Consider giving a "Martial Artist" a "Claw" attack, or allowing a dragon creature type to get a Bite.

### Claw / Hoof

A Claw or Hoof is a strike with a creature's limb. These tend to have a mix of power and damage behind it.

|Tier | Level | Metal      | Type     | Color | Might | Accuracy | Range
|:--- | :---  | :---       | :---     | :---  | ---:  | ---:     | :---
| E   | 1     | Copper     | Physical | Green | 4     | 95       | 1
| D   | 2     | Bronze     | Physical | Green | 7     | 85       | 1
| C   | 3     | Iron       | Physical | Green | 10    | 75       | 1
| B   | 4     | Steel      | Physical | Green | 13    | 65       | 1
| A   | 5     | Silvered   | Physical | Green | 16    | 55       | 1
| S   | 6     | Gilded     | Physical | Green | 19    | 45       | 1
| S+  | 7     | Orichalcum | Physical | Green | 22    | 35       | 1

### Bite / Gore

A Bite or Gore attack is done with the creature's head. It's a risky maneuver, but the creature can put it's full weight behind it.

|Tier | Level | Metal      | Type     | Color | Might | Accuracy | Range
|:--- | :---  | :---       | :---     | :---  | ---:  | ---:     | :---
| E   | 1     | Copper     | Physical | Red   | 4     | 95       | 1
| D   | 2     | Bronze     | Physical | Red   | 8     | 80       | 1
| C   | 3     | Iron       | Physical | Red   | 12    | 65       | 1
| B   | 4     | Steel      | Physical | Red   | 16    | 50       | 1
| A   | 5     | Silvered   | Physical | Red   | 20    | 35       | 1
| S   | 6     | Gilded     | Physical | Red   | 24    | 20       | 1
| S+  | 7     | Orichalcum | Physical | Red   | 28    | 5        | 1

### Sting

Stings are thin, piercing weapons used by creatures. They have a high amount of precision.

|Tier | Level | Metal      | Type     | Color | Might | Accuracy | Range
|:--- | :---  | :---       | :---     | :---  | ---:  | ---:     | :---
| E   | 1     | Copper     | Physical | Blue  | 4     | 95       | 1
| D   | 2     | Bronze     | Physical | Blue  | 6     | 90       | 1
| C   | 3     | Iron       | Physical | Blue  | 8     | 85       | 1
| B   | 4     | Steel      | Physical | Blue  | 10    | 80       | 1
| A   | 5     | Silvered   | Physical | Blue  | 12    | 75       | 1
| S   | 6     | Gilded     | Physical | Blue  | 14    | 70       | 1
| S+  | 7     | Orichalcum | Physical | Blue  | 16    | 65       | 1

### Slam

Slam attacks are performed with the creature's body, or sometimes with a heavy appendage like a tail.

|Tier | Level | Metal      | Type     | Color | Might | Accuracy | Range
|:--- | :---  | :---       | :---     | :---  | ---:  | ---:     | :---
| E   | 1     | Copper     | Physical | Grey  | 1     | 90       | 1
| D   | 2     | Bronze     | Physical | Grey  | 3     | 80       | 1
| C   | 3     | Iron       | Physical | Grey  | 6     | 70       | 1
| B   | 4     | Steel      | Physical | Grey  | 8     | 60       | 1
| A   | 5     | Silvered   | Physical | Grey  | 11    | 50       | 1
| S   | 6     | Gilded     | Physical | Grey  | 13    | 40       | 1
| S+  | 7     | Orichalcum | Physical | Grey  | 16    | 30       | 1

### Magic Attacks

Some magical creatures might have magical attacks, for example a dragon's breath. In these cases, the best way to represent this is to simply choose one of the player spells, and flavor the attack as coming from the creature's nature, instead of a specific book.

## Designing Creatures

This is where you let your creative muscle flex. Using the rules as given, consider the following outlines of creatures that can be made:

- Minotaur
  - Base Creature Type: Dwarf
  - Weapons: Gore, Ax
  - Stats: High **STR** and **DEF**, low **INT** and **SPD**
- Centaur
  - Base Creature Type: Human
  - Weapons: Hoof, Bow
  - Stats: High **SKL** and **SPD**, low **DEF** and **HP**
  - Skills: Ride
- Harpy
  - Base Creature Type: Carnivore
  - Weapons: Claw, Wind
  - Stats: High **WIS**
  - Skills: Fly, Sing
- Ancient Dragon (Boss Monster Option)
  - Base Creature Type: Dragon
  - Weapons: Claw, Fire
  - Stats: High **STR** and **INT**, low **SPD**
  - Skills: Fly

All you have to do is get close to the feeling of the creature. Once done, your description of the situation will carry everything the rest of the way.

If any of your creatures need to exist for more than a brief moment on screen, one or two **Quirks** for them. If the creature isn't intelligent, then one quirk representing the creature type should suffice. If the creature is independent, a second quirk representing something about that particular creature can help add definition to the creature and help with roleplaying with and around it.

## Designing Traps

There are two types of traps to consider, and when including a trap in a map you need to decide which one you want to use. Quirk traps are often used more as barriers that prevent progress, and they tend to have HP and are defeated through quirk tests. These would be things like Gas traps, or rooms filling with water, or large hallways covered in pit traps.

Combat traps are a little different. Combat traps are a type of terrain, And they engage against anyone who passes over the map square it occupies. Traps have a base **Accuracy** of the traps **level**, and have a base **Might** of half the traps level. Then, the trap equips any weapon to finish off it's setup. Anyone stepping on a trapped square gets **struck** by the trap, and the trap takes no **Ripostes** or **Follow Through Ripostes** in response. For example, a Level 16 pit trap would be equipped with an Iron Slam, Have 86% **Accuracy**,  14 **Might**. The trap could be runed with a Heavy Lv2 rune, in which case it would have 16 Damage. Alternatively, the pit trap could be spiked, in which case it would be based on an Iron Lance, with 91% **Accuracy** and 20 **Might** with that heavy Rune. This would be Blue colored, though, so the triangle still applies.
