# Chapter 8 - Setting

Adelphia is a land of wonder, if you can call it a land at all

## Kingdom of the Clouds

The air is thick in Adelphia, and large rocks float like islands in a sea of clouds and sky. Here large ships move through the air, delivering goods and people to their desired destination.
