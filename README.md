# Adelphia
Adelphia is a pen and paper variant of the Fire Emblem game mechanics. This is attempt to come full circle, to bring the video game back to its roots in the Pen and Paper RPG setting. Although derrived from traditional Fire Emblem combat mechanics, a significant amount of change has been implimented in order to enable a multiplayer, roll-playing environment where a computer is only helpful, and not required. 

## Fire Emblem
Fire Emblem was the first computer aided tactical role playing game. First released in Japan in 1990, the game combined basic role playing game staples with turn based strategy. While popular in Japan, it didn’t see worldwide release until 2003, with the release of "Fire Emblem" for the Game Boy Advance, due to the inclusion of two of the series’ main characters in "Super Smash Brothers: Melee."

The most defining features of the series are the weapon triangles and the permanent deaths of the characters. Combat is done in a rock-paper-scissors type fashion, with swords working well against axes which work well against lances. Also, when a character is defeated in combat, they remain unusable for the rest of the game.

## Computer Integration
Everything in this system should be completely useable without computer assistance. However, some basic computer assistance with tracking character stats can greatly speed up combat. Currently supported by the system is a roll20 character sheet, and a roll20 combat API.
