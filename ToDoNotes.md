# Scratch Paper

A place for notes.

## Layout

+ Chapter 1 should be split into two chapters: a brief introduction to tabletop roll playing games, and a second "quick reference guide" section
+ There should probably be a Chapter 8 for Game Masters about running the game outside of combat.
+ The skill and Rune lists should probably be alphabetized, or at least rearranged to make a little more sense.

## Meta

+ Should there be a "Monster Manual" and a "Basic Setting" book?
+ Currently going with "yes".

## Gamedev Talk Notes

+ Character Creation should be back-to-front. Require less jumping around if possible.

+ Mechanical Level increase?
  + Make it more static, or even push for static levels?

+ Runes are weird. Maybe actually playtest them.

+ Various little things.
  + The way the stats are divided. (Main Stats (vs HP, LUK, and MOV))
    + Make HP a calculated stat.
  + Look for Evade vs Avoid.
  + Why "Class Points?"
    + Character Points, Base Points
  + Growth Points unclear. What are Growth Points. Fix labeling
  + Remove Growth bonuses from class skills.
  + Remove skill points. Just get skills.
  + Skill points should be "while" instead of "if"
  + Combat is inconsistently defined.
    + Engagements vs Combats.
  + Tune Axes? For the love of God.
  + Is defense too good?
  + How much does existential Gameplay get in the way of the tabletop experience.
  + Clarify Great Skills. Are they upgrades. Do you only get one. When do you get them?
  + Clarify Respec-ing.
