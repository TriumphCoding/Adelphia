+ Chapter 1 should be split into two chapters: a brief introduction to tabletop roll playing games, and a second "quick reference guide" section
+ There should probably be a Chapter 8 for Game Masters about running the game outside of combat.
+ The skill and Rune lists should probably be alphabetized, or at least rearranged to make a little more sense.

# Meta

+ Should there be a "Monster Manual" and a "Basic Setting" book?
